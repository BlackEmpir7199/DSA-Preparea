# ðŸ”¢ **Counting Bits**

## Problem Description

Given an integer `n`, return an array `ans` of length `n + 1` such that for each `i` (0 â‰¤ i â‰¤ n), `ans[i]` is the number of 1's in the binary representation of `i`.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to count the number of 1's in the binary representation of each integer from 0 to `n`.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: n = 2
Output: [0, 1, 1]
Explanation:
- 0 --> 0 (0 ones)
- 1 --> 1 (1 one)
- 2 --> 10 (1 one)
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: n = 5
Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2]
Explanation:
- 0 --> 0 (0 ones)
- 1 --> 1 (1 one)
- 2 --> 10 (1 one)
- 3 --> 11 (2 ones)
- 4 --> 100 (1 one)
- 5 --> 101 (2 ones)
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Dynamic Programming with Bit Manipulation**

The algorithm efficiently counts the number of 1's in the binary representation of each number:

- **Initialization**:
  - Create an array `ans` of size `n + 1` to store the count of 1's for each number.

- **Bit Manipulation**:
  - For each number `i`, calculate the number of 1's using the formula:
    \[
    \text{ans}[i] = \text{ans}[i >> 1] + (i \& 1)
    \]
  - This formula leverages the fact that the number of 1's in `i` is equal to the number of 1's in `i >> 1` (which is `i` right-shifted by 1, effectively dividing by 2) plus the least significant bit of `i` (which is `i & 1`).

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(n)** extra space to store the results.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countBits(int n) {
        vector<int> ans(n + 1);
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            ans[i] = ans[i >> 1] + (i & 1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 0 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**
