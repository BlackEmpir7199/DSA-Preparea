# 371. Sum of Two Integers

## Problem Description
Given two integers `a` and `b`, return the sum of the two integers without using the operators `+` and `-`.

### Examples
- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `a = 1`, `b = 2`
  - Output: `3`

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `a = 2`, `b = 3`
  - Output: `5`

### Constraints
- `-1000 <= a, b <= 1000`

## Approach
The solution uses **bit manipulation** to simulate the addition of two integers without using the `+` or `-` operators. The key idea is to use the XOR operation to calculate the sum of the bits without carry and the AND operation followed by a left shift to calculate the carry.

### Key Steps:
1. **Calculate Sum Without Carry**: The XOR operation (`a ^ b`) gives the sum of the bits without considering the carry.
2. **Calculate Carry**: The AND operation (`a & b`) followed by a left shift (`<< 1`) gives the carry.
3. **Iterate Until No Carry**: Repeat the above steps with the new sum and carry until there is no carry left (i.e., `b == 0`).

### Solution Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getSum(int a, int b) {
        while(b != 0){
            int temp = a;
            a ^= b;          // Sum without carry
            b = (temp & b) << 1; // Carry
        }
        return a;
    }
};
```

## Explanation
1. **Initialization**: Start with the given integers `a` and `b`.
2. **Loop Until No Carry**:
   - **Sum Without Carry**: `a ^ b` computes the sum of the bits without considering the carry.
   - **Carry Calculation**: `(a & b) << 1` computes the carry and shifts it left by 1 bit to align it correctly for the next addition.
   - **Update Values**: Update `a` to be the sum without carry and `b` to be the carry. Repeat the process until `b` becomes zero.
3. **Return Result**: Once there is no carry left (`b == 0`), `a` contains the final sum.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: `O(1)` for fixed-size integers (since the loop runs at most 32 times for 32-bit integers).
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` as no additional space is used.

This approach efficiently simulates the addition operation using bitwise operations, adhering to the constraint of not using `+` or `-` operators.
