# ðŸ”¢ **Single Number III**

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice, find the two elements that appear only once. You can return the answer in any order.

You must write an algorithm that runs in linear runtime complexity and uses only constant extra space.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to find the two unique elements in the array.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5]
Output: [3, 5]
Explanation: [5, 3] is also a valid answer.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [-1, 0]
Output: [-1, 0]
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [0, 1]
Output: [1, 0]
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Bit Manipulation**:

1. **XOR All Elements**:
   - XOR all the elements in the array. The result will be the XOR of the two unique numbers since \( x \oplus x = 0 \) and \( x \oplus 0 = x \).

2. **Find a Set Bit**:
   - Find a bit that is set in the XOR result. This bit will be different in the two unique numbers. Use `xr & (-xr)` to find the rightmost set bit.

3. **Partition the Numbers**:
   - Partition the numbers into two groups based on whether the set bit is present. XOR all the numbers in each group to find the two unique numbers.

4. **Result**:
   - Return the two unique numbers.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the array. This is because we make a single pass through the array to XOR the elements and another pass to partition and XOR the groups.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(1)** extra space.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int xr = 0;
        for (int i : nums) xr ^= i;
        long long setBit = xr & (-1ll * xr);
        int first = 0;
        for (int i : nums) {
            if ((i & setBit) != 0) first ^= i;
        }
        return {first, first ^ xr};
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 2 \leq \text{nums.length} \leq 3 \times 10^4 \)
- \( -2^{31} \leq \text{nums}[i] \leq 2^{31} - 1 \)
- Each integer in `nums` will appear twice, only two integers will appear once.

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently finds the two unique numbers using bit manipulation.
- The solution handles the input effectively within the given constraints.
- The use of XOR and bit masking allows for a linear time complexity solution with constant extra space.
