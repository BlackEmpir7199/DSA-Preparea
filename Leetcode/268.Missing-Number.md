**LeetCode - 268. Missing Number üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è**

**The Mystery of the Missing Number**

You're a detective on a special case: finding the missing number in a sequence of integers. The suspect pool consists of all numbers from 0 to n, where n is the number of suspects (integers) in the array. 

**The Challenge**

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, your mission is to identify the one number that's playing hide-and-seek.

**The Detective's Approach: The Summation Sleuth**

* **The Expected Lineup:** 
    * If all the suspects were present, we could calculate the expected sum of their values. 
    * Let's call this the "perfect lineup sum."

* **The Actual Lineup:**
    * We'll sum up the values of the suspects actually present in the array.

* **Finding the Culprit:**
    * The difference between the "perfect lineup sum" and the "actual lineup sum" reveals the missing number!

**The Code: The Detective's Notebook**

```java
class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length; 
        int expectedSum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2; // Perfect lineup sum
        int actualSum = 0; 
        for (int num : nums) {
            actualSum += num; 
        }
        return expectedSum - actualSum; // The missing number revealed!
    }
}
```

**Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity: O(n)** 
    * We need to "interview" each suspect (integer) in the array once.
* **Space Complexity: O(1)** 
    * We only need a small amount of memory to keep track of the sums.

**Why This Works: The Detective's Logic**

By calculating the expected sum and subtracting the actual sum, we effectively eliminate all the present numbers. The remaining value is our missing number ‚Äì the one that disrupted the perfect lineup!

**Conclusion**

This solution elegantly solves the "Missing Number" mystery using a simple yet effective mathematical approach. 

**Note:** This method fulfills the requirements of O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity.

I hope this README provides a clear and engaging explanation of the solution!
