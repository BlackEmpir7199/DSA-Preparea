# üçá **Fruit Into Baskets**

## Problem Description

You are visiting a farm with a single row of fruit trees, represented by an integer array `fruits`, where `fruits[i]` is the type of fruit the `i-th` tree produces. You want to collect as much fruit as possible, but you only have two baskets, and each basket can hold a single type of fruit. You must pick exactly one fruit from every tree while moving to the right, and the picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets. Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.

Return the maximum number of fruits you can pick.

## üéØ **Objective**

Write a function to determine the maximum number of fruits you can pick while adhering to the given constraints.

## ‚ú® **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: fruits = [1, 2, 1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from all 3 trees.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: fruits = [0, 1, 2, 2]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from trees [1, 2, 2]. If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [0, 1].
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: fruits = [1, 2, 3, 2, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can pick from trees [2, 3, 2, 2]. If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [1, 2].
```

## üöÄ **Approach**

### **Sliding Window with Two Pointers**

The algorithm uses a sliding window approach with two pointers to efficiently determine the maximum number of fruits that can be picked:

- **Initialization**:
  - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, both starting at the beginning of the array.
  - Initialize a hash map `mpp` to keep track of the count of each type of fruit.
  - Initialize `maxi` to `INT_MIN` to keep track of the maximum number of fruits picked.

- **Traversal**:
  - Traverse the array with the `right` pointer.
  - Increment the count of the current fruit `fruits[right]` in the hash map.
  - While the hash map contains more than two types of fruits, move the `left` pointer to the right, decrementing the count of `fruits[left]` in the hash map. If the count of `fruits[left]` becomes zero, remove it from the hash map.
  - Update `maxi` with the maximum value between `maxi` and `(right - left + 1)`.
  - Move the `right` pointer to the right.

- **Return the Maximum Count**:
  - Return `maxi` as the maximum number of fruits that can be picked.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where `n` is the length of the array. This is because each element is visited at most twice.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(1)** space, as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

## üí° **Code Implementation**

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int totalFruit(vector<int>& fruits) {
        int right = 0, left = 0, n = fruits.size(), maxi = INT_MIN;
        unordered_map<int, int> mpp;
        while (right < n) {
            mpp[fruits[right]]++;
            while (mpp.size() > 2) {
                mpp[fruits[left]]--;
                if (mpp[fruits[left]] == 0) mpp.erase(fruits[left]);
                left++;
            }
            maxi = max(maxi, right - left + 1);
            right++;
        }
        return maxi;
    }
};
```

## üîß **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{fruits.length} \leq 10^5 \)
- \( 0 \leq \text{fruits}[i] < \text{fruits.length} \)

## üåü **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently determines the maximum number of fruits that can be picked using a sliding window approach.
- The solution handles the problem in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes.
- The use of two pointers allows for an efficient traversal and calculation of the maximum number of fruits.
