# üîç **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**

## Problem Description

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

## üéØ **Objective**

Write a function to determine the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## ‚ú® **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

## üöÄ **Approach**

### **Sliding Window with Hash Map**

The algorithm uses a sliding window approach with a hash map to efficiently find the longest substring without repeating characters:

- **Initialization**:
  - Use a hash map `mpp` to store the frequency of characters in the current window.
  - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the current window.
  - Initialize `maxi` to keep track of the maximum length of the substring without repeating characters.

- **Sliding Window**:
  - Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer and adding the current character to the hash map.
  - If the frequency of the current character exceeds 1, shrink the window from the left until the frequency of the current character is 1.
  - Update `maxi` with the maximum length of the current window.

- **Termination**:
  - The loop terminates when the `right` pointer reaches the end of the string.
  - Return `maxi` as the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the string.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(min(n, m))** space, where \( m \) is the size of the character set.

## üí° **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        if (s.size() == 0) return 0;
        unordered_map<char, int> mpp;
        int right = 0, left = 0;
        int maxi = INT_MIN;
        while (right < s.size()) {
            mpp[s[right]]++;
            while (mpp[s[right]] > 1) {
                mpp[s[left]]--;
                left++;
            }
            maxi = max(right - left + 1, maxi);
            right++;
        }
        return maxi;
    }
};
```

## üîß **Constraints**

- \( 0 \leq \text{s.length} \leq 5 \times 10^4 \)
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols, and spaces.

## üåü **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently finds the longest substring without repeating characters using a sliding window approach.
- The solution handles the constraints well and ensures that the substring is accurately determined.
- The use of a hash map allows for an efficient tracking of character frequencies.
