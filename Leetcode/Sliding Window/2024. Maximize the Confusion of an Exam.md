# üìù **Maximize the Confusion of an Exam**

## Problem Description

A teacher is writing a test with `n` true/false questions, with `'T'` denoting true and `'F'` denoting false. The goal is to confuse the students by maximizing the number of consecutive questions with the same answer (multiple trues or multiple falses in a row).

You are given a string `answerKey`, where `answerKey[i]` is the original answer to the `i-th` question. Additionally, you are given an integer `k`, the maximum number of times you may change the answer key for any question to `'T'` or `'F'`.

The objective is to return the maximum number of consecutive `'T's` or `'F's` in the answer key after performing the operation at most `k` times.

## üéØ **Objective**

Write a function to determine the maximum number of consecutive `'T's` or `'F's` after performing at most `k` changes.

## ‚ú® **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: answerKey = "TTFF", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: We can replace both the 'F's with 'T's to make answerKey = "TTTT".
There are four consecutive 'T's.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: answerKey = "TFFT", k = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: We can replace the first 'T' with an 'F' to make answerKey = "FFFT".
Alternatively, we can replace the second 'T' with an 'F' to make answerKey = "TFFF".
In both cases, there are three consecutive 'F's.
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: answerKey = "TTFTTFTT", k = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: We can replace the first 'F' to make answerKey = "TTTTTFTT".
Alternatively, we can replace the second 'F' to make answerKey = "TTFTTTTT".
In both cases, there are five consecutive 'T's.
```

## üöÄ **Approach**

### **Sliding Window with Two-Pointer Technique**

The algorithm efficiently finds the maximum number of consecutive `'T's` or `'F's` using a sliding window approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a hashmap `mpp` to store the frequency of characters in the current window.
   - Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the current window of the substring.
   - Use variables `maxfreq` to store the maximum frequency of any character in the current window and `maxi` to store the maximum length of the valid substring.

2. **Sliding Window**:
   - Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer and updating the frequency of the character at `right`.
   - Update `maxfreq` to be the maximum frequency of any character in the current window.
   - If the number of characters that need to be replaced to make all characters the same exceeds `k`, shrink the window from the left until the condition is satisfied.
   - Update `maxi` to be the maximum length of the valid substring found.

3. **Count Subarrays**:
   - For each valid position of `right`, update `maxi` to be the maximum length of the valid substring ending at `right`.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the string.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(1)** extra space since the hashmap stores at most 2 characters.

## üí° **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxConsecutiveAnswers(string s, int k) {
        unordered_map<char,int> mpp;
        int r=0,l=0,maxfreq =0,maxi=0,n=s.size();
        while(r<n){
            mpp[s[r]]++;
            maxfreq = max(maxfreq,mpp[s[r]]);
            while(((r-l+1)-maxfreq)>k){
                mpp[s[l]]--;
                l++;
            }
            maxi = max(maxi,r-l+1);
            r++;
        }
        return maxi;
    }
};
```

## üîß **Constraints**

- \( n == \text{answerKey.length} \)
- \( 1 \leq n \leq 5 \times 10^4 \)
- `answerKey[i]` is either `'T'` or `'F'`
- \( 1 \leq k \leq n \)

## üåü **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently finds the maximum number of consecutive `'T's` or `'F's` using a sliding window technique.
- The solution handles large inputs effectively within the given constraints.
- The use of two pointers allows for a linear time complexity solution.
