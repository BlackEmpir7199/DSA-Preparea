# ðŸ”¤ **Find All Anagrams in a String**

## Problem Description

Given two strings `s` and `p`, return an array of all the start indices of `p`'s anagrams in `s`. You may return the answer in any order.

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to find all start indices of anagrams of string `p` in string `s`.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
Output: [0, 6]
Explanation:
- The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
- The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
Output: [0, 1, 2]
Explanation:
- The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
- The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
- The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Sliding Window Technique**:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create two hash maps (`shash` and `phash`) to store the frequency of characters in the current window of `s` and the string `p`, respectively.
   - Initialize the size of `p` as `n` and the size of `s` as `m`.

2. **Edge Case**:
   - If the length of `p` is greater than the length of `s`, return an empty array since no anagrams can be found.

3. **Initial Window**:
   - Populate the initial window of size `n` in `s` and the entire string `p` into their respective hash maps.
   - Check if the initial window is an anagram of `p` and add the start index to the result if true.

4. **Sliding the Window**:
   - Slide the window one character at a time from the start of `s` to the end.
   - For each new character added to the window, update the hash map `shash`.
   - For each character that slides out of the window, decrement its count in `shash`.
   - Check if the current window is an anagram of `p` and add the start index to the result if true.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(m)** time, where \( m \) is the length of the string `s`. This is because each character is processed at most twice (once when entering and once when leaving the window).

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(1)** extra space for the hash maps since the size of the character set is fixed (26 lowercase English letters).

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findAnagrams(string s, string p) {
        vector<int> shash(26, 0), phash(26, 0), ans;
        int n = p.size(), m = s.size();
        if (n > m) return ans;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            shash[s[i] - 'a']++;
            phash[p[i] - 'a']++;
        }

        if (phash == shash) ans.push_back(0);

        for (int i = n; i < m; i++) {
            shash[s[i] - 'a']++;
            shash[s[i - n] - 'a']--;
            if (phash == shash) ans.push_back(i - n + 1);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{s.length}, \text{p.length} \leq 3 \times 10^4 \)
- `s` and `p` consist of lowercase English letters.

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently finds all start indices of anagrams using the sliding window technique.
- The solution handles the input effectively within the given constraints.
- The use of hash maps allows for quick comparison of character frequencies.
