# ðŸ”¤ **Longest Repeating Character Replacement**

## Problem Description

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, you can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most `k` times. The goal is to determine the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to find the length of the longest substring containing the same letter after performing at most `k` replacements.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
There may exist other ways to achieve this answer too.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Sliding Window with Two-Pointer Technique**

The algorithm efficiently finds the longest substring using a sliding window approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the current window of the substring.
   - Use a hashmap `mpp` to store the frequency of characters in the current window.
   - Use variables `maxfreq` to store the maximum frequency of any character in the current window and `maxi` to store the maximum length of the valid substring.

2. **Sliding Window**:
   - Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer and updating the frequency of the character at `right`.
   - Update `maxfreq` to be the maximum frequency of any character in the current window.
   - If the number of characters that need to be replaced to make all characters the same exceeds `k`, shrink the window from the left until the condition is satisfied.
   - Update `maxi` to be the maximum length of the valid substring found.

3. **Count Subarrays**:
   - For each valid position of `right`, update `maxi` to be the maximum length of the valid substring ending at `right`.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the string.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(1)** extra space since the hashmap stores at most 26 characters.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int characterReplacement(string s, int k) {
        unordered_map<char,int> mpp;
        int r=0,l=0,maxfreq =0,maxi=0,n=s.size();
        while(r<n){
            mpp[s[r]]++;
            maxfreq = max(maxfreq,mpp[s[r]]);
            while(((r-l+1)-maxfreq)>k){
                mpp[s[l]]--;
                l++;
            }
            maxi = max(maxi,r-l+1);
            r++;
        }
        return maxi;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{s.length} \leq 10^5 \)
- `s` consists of only uppercase English letters.
- \( 0 \leq k \leq \text{s.length} \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently finds the longest substring with the same character after at most `k` replacements using the sliding window technique.
- The solution handles large inputs effectively within the given constraints.
- The use of two pointers allows for a linear time complexity solution.
