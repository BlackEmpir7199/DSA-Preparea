# ðŸ”— **Subarray Product Less Than K**

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is strictly less than `k`.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to count the number of contiguous subarrays whose product is strictly less than `k`.

## âœ¨ **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [10, 5, 2, 6], k = 100
Output: 8
Explanation: The 8 subarrays that have product less than 100 are:
[10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6]
Note that [10, 5, 2] is not included as the product of 100 is not strictly less than k.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3], k = 0
Output: 0
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Sliding Window with Two Pointers**

The algorithm uses a sliding window approach with two pointers to efficiently count the subarrays:

- **Initialization**:
  - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, both starting at the beginning of the array.
  - Initialize `prod` to 1 to keep track of the product of the current window.
  - Initialize `cnt` to 0 to keep track of the count of valid subarrays.

- **Edge Case**:
  - If `k` is less than or equal to 1, return 0 because no subarray product can be less than `k`.

- **Traversal**:
  - Traverse the array with the `right` pointer.
  - Multiply the current element `nums[right]` to `prod`.
  - If `prod` is greater than or equal to `k`, move the `left` pointer to the right until `prod` is less than `k`, dividing `prod` by `nums[left]` each time.
  - For each valid window ending at `right`, all subarrays ending at `right` and starting from `left` to `right` are valid. Add `(right - left + 1)` to `cnt`.

- **Return the Count**:
  - Return the count of valid subarrays.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is because each element is visited at most twice.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(1)** space, as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numSubarrayProductLessThanK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int right = 0, left = 0, prod = 1, cnt = 0;
        if (k <= 1) return 0;
        int n = nums.size();
        while (right < n) {
            prod *= nums[right];
            while (prod >= k) prod /= nums[left++];
            cnt += (right - left + 1);
            right++;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{nums.length} \leq 3 \times 10^4 \)
- \( 1 \leq \text{nums}[i] \leq 1000 \)
- \( 0 \leq k \leq 10^6 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently counts the number of subarrays with a product less than `k` using a sliding window approach.
- The solution handles edge cases, such as when `k` is less than or equal to 1.
- The use of two pointers allows for an efficient traversal and calculation of the product.
