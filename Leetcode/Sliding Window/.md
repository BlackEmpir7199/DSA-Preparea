# ðŸ”— **Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters**

## Problem Description

Given a string `s` consisting only of characters `a`, `b`, and `c`, return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters `a`, `b`, and `c`.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to count the number of substrings that contain at least one occurrence of the characters `a`, `b`, and `c`.

## âœ¨ **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: s = "abcabc"
Output: 10
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b, and c are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc", "bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc", and "abc" (again).
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: s = "aaacb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b, and c are "aaacb", "aacb", and "acb".
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 1
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Sliding Window with Two Pointers**

The algorithm uses a sliding window approach with two pointers to efficiently count the substrings:

- **Initialization**:
  - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, both starting at the beginning of the string.
  - Initialize a hash map `mpp` to keep track of the count of characters `a`, `b`, and `c`.
  - Initialize `cnt` to 0 to keep track of the count of valid substrings.

- **Traversal**:
  - Traverse the string with the `right` pointer.
  - Increment the count of the current character `s[right]` in the hash map.
  - While the hash map contains at least one occurrence of `a`, `b`, and `c`, increment the count of valid substrings by `(n - right)` and move the `left` pointer to the right, decrementing the count of `s[left]` in the hash map.
  - Move the `right` pointer to the right.

- **Return the Count**:
  - Return the count of valid substrings.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where `n` is the length of the string. This is because each character is visited at most twice.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(1)** space, as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfSubstrings(string s) {
        int right = 0, left = 0, n = s.size(), cnt = 0;
        unordered_map<char, int> mpp;
        mpp['a'] = 0, mpp['b'] = 0, mpp['c'] = 0;
        while (right < n) {
            mpp[s[right]]++;
            while (mpp['a'] > 0 && mpp['b'] > 0 && mpp['c'] > 0) {
                cnt += n - right;
                mpp[s[left]]--;
                left++;
            }
            right++;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 3 \leq \text{s.length} \leq 5 \times 10^4 \)
- `s` only consists of `a`, `b`, or `c` characters.

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently counts the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of `a`, `b`, and `c` using a sliding window approach.
- The solution handles the problem in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes.
- The use of two pointers allows for an efficient traversal and calculation of the substrings.
