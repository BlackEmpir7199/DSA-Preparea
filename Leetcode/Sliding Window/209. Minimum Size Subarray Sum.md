# ðŸ”¢ **Minimum Size Subarray Sum**

## Problem Description

Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`, find the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to `target`. If no such subarray exists, return `0`.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to determine the minimum length of a subarray that meets the given condition.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: target = 7, nums = [2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3]
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarray [4, 3] has the minimal length with a sum greater than or equal to 7.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: target = 4, nums = [1, 4, 4]
Output: 1
Explanation: The subarray [4] has the minimal length with a sum greater than or equal to 4.
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: target = 11, nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no subarray with a sum greater than or equal to 11.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Sliding Window Technique**

The algorithm uses a sliding window to efficiently find the minimum length subarray:

- **Initialization**:
  - Use two pointers, `i` and `j`, to represent the start and end of the sliding window.
  - Use a variable `sum` to keep track of the sum of elements in the current window.

- **Window Expansion and Contraction**:
  - Expand the window by moving the `j` pointer and adding elements to `sum`.
  - When `sum` is greater than or equal to `target`, contract the window from the left by moving the `i` pointer and subtracting elements from `sum`.
  - Track the minimum length of the window that satisfies the condition.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the array.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSubArrayLen(int target, vector<int>& nums) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        int mini = INT_MAX;
        while (j < nums.size()) {
            sum += nums[j];
            j++;
            while (sum >= target) {
                mini = min(mini, j - i);
                sum -= nums[i];
                i++;
            }
        }
        return mini == INT_MAX ? 0 : mini;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{target} \leq 10^9 \)
- \( 1 \leq \text{nums.length} \leq 10^5 \)
- \( 1 \leq \text{nums}[i] \leq 10^4 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The sliding window technique efficiently finds the minimum length subarray with the required sum.
- The solution handles large inputs effectively within the given constraints.
- The use of two pointers allows for a linear time complexity solution.
