# ðŸ“Š **Maximum Average Subarray I**

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `nums` consisting of \( n \) elements and an integer \( k \). Your task is to find a contiguous subarray of length \( k \) that has the maximum average value. Return this maximum average value. Any answer with a calculation error less than \( 10^{-5} \) will be accepted.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to calculate the maximum average of any subarray of length \( k \) within the given array.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1, 12, -5, -6, 50, 3], k = 4
Output: 12.75000
Explanation: The subarray [12, -5, -6, 50] has the maximum average: (12 - 5 - 6 + 50) / 4 = 51 / 4 = 12.75.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [5], k = 1
Output: 5.00000
Explanation: The only subarray of length 1 is [5], and its average is 5.0.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Sliding Window Technique**

The algorithm uses the sliding window technique to efficiently find the maximum average:

- **Initialization**:
  - Use two pointers, `i` and `j`, both starting at the beginning of the array.
  - Maintain a variable `sum` to keep the sum of the current window of size \( k \).

- **Sliding Window**:
  - Expand the window by moving the `j` pointer and adding `nums[j]` to `sum`.
  - When the window size reaches \( k \), calculate the average and update the maximum average if the current average is greater.
  - Slide the window by moving the `i` pointer and subtracting `nums[i]` from `sum`.

- **Update**:
  - Continue sliding the window until the end of the array, updating the maximum average as needed.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the array.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double findMaxAverage(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        double sum = 0;
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        double maxi = INT_MIN;
        while (i < nums.size() && j < nums.size()) {
            sum += nums[j];
            if (j - i + 1 == k) {
                maxi = max(sum / k, maxi);
                sum -= nums[i];
                i++;
            }
            j++;
        }
        return maxi;
    }
};
```

---

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( n == \text{nums.length} \)
- \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^5 \)
- \( -10^4 \leq \text{nums}[i] \leq 10^4 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The sliding window technique efficiently calculates the maximum average for subarrays of length \( k \).
- The solution handles large arrays within the given constraints effectively.
- The implementation ensures that the calculation error is within acceptable limits.
