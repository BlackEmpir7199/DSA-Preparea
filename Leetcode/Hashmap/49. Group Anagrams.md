# 🔤 **Group Anagrams**

## Problem Description

Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

## 🎯 **Objective**

Write a function to group anagrams from a list of strings.

## ✨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: strs = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
Output: [["bat"], ["nat", "tan"], ["ate", "eat", "tea"]]
Explanation:
- There is no string in `strs` that can be rearranged to form "bat".
- The strings "nat" and "tan" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
- The strings "ate", "eat", and "tea" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
```

## 🚀 **Approach**

### **Character Sorting**

The algorithm uses a hash map to group anagrams by sorting the characters in each string:

- **Initialization**:
  - Create a hash map where the key is the sorted string and the value is a list of anagrams.

- **Sort and Group**:
  - For each string in the input array, sort the characters.
  - Use the sorted string as a key in the hash map and add the original string to the corresponding list.

- **Collect Results**:
  - Iterate through the hash map and collect all the lists of anagrams.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n \cdot k \log k)** time, where \( n \) is the number of strings and \( k \) is the maximum length of a string.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(n \cdot k)** extra space to store the sorted strings and the grouped anagrams.

## 💡 **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> groupAnagrams(vector<string>& strs) {
        vector<vector<string>> ans;
        unordered_map<string, vector<string>> map;
        for (string s : strs) {
            string temp = s;
            sort(temp.begin(), temp.end());
            map[temp].push_back(s);
        }
        for (auto it : map) {
            ans.push_back(it.second);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## 🔧 **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{strs.length} \leq 10^4 \)
- \( 0 \leq \text{strs[i].length} \leq 100 \)
- `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

## 🌟 **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently groups anagrams using a hash map and sorting.
- The solution handles the constraints well and ensures that the result is accurate.
- The use of sorting allows for a straightforward way to identify anagrams.

## 🔍 **Follow-up**

If the inputs contain Unicode characters, the solution can be adapted by using a sorting algorithm that supports Unicode characters. The approach remains the same, but the sorting function would need to handle a larger set of possible characters. The time complexity would still be **O(n \cdot k \log k)**, but the space complexity might increase depending on the range of Unicode characters used.
