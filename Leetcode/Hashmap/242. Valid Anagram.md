# 🔤 **Valid Anagram**

## Problem Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if `t` is an anagram of `s`. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## 🎯 **Objective**

Write a function to check if two strings are anagrams of each other.

## ✨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
Explanation: Both strings contain the same characters with the same frequencies.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
Explanation: The strings do not contain the same characters with the same frequencies.
```

## 🚀 **Approach**

### **Character Counting**

The algorithm uses a hash map to count the frequency of each character in the strings:

- **Initialization**:
  - Check if the lengths of `s` and `t` are equal. If not, return `false`.

- **Count Characters**:
  - Use a hash map to count the occurrences of each character in `s`.
  - Decrement the count for each character in `t`. If a character in `t` is not found in the map or its count goes negative, return `false`.

- **Validation**:
  - If all characters in `t` are successfully matched with characters in `s`, return `true`.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the strings.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(1)** extra space due to the fixed size of the character set (assuming only lowercase English letters).

## 💡 **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isAnagram(string s, string t) {
        if (s.size() != t.size()) return false;
        unordered_map<char, int> map;
        for (char c : s) {
            map[c]++;
        }
        for (char c : t) {
            if (map[c] != 0)
                map[c]--;
            else
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

## 🔧 **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{s.length}, \text{t.length} \leq 5 \times 10^4 \)
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

## 🌟 **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently checks if two strings are anagrams using a hash map to count character frequencies.
- The solution handles the constraints well and ensures that the result is accurate.
- The use of a hash map allows for a linear time complexity solution.

## 🔍 **Follow-up**

If the inputs contain Unicode characters, the solution can be adapted by using a hash map that supports Unicode characters. The approach remains the same, but the hash map would need to accommodate a larger set of possible characters. The time complexity would still be **O(n)**, but the space complexity might increase depending on the range of Unicode characters used.
