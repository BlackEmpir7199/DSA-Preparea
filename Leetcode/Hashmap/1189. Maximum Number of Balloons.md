# ðŸŽˆ **Maximum Number of Balloons**

## Problem Description

Given a string `text`, determine the maximum number of instances of the word "balloon" that can be formed using the characters in `text`. Each character in `text` can be used at most once per instance of "balloon".

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to calculate the maximum number of "balloon" instances that can be formed from the given string.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: text = "nlaebolko"
Output: 1
Explanation: The characters in "nlaebolko" can form one instance of "balloon".
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: text = "loonbalxballpoon"
Output: 2
Explanation: The characters in "loonbalxballpoon" can form two instances of "balloon".
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: text = "leetcode"
Output: 0
Explanation: The characters in "leetcode" cannot form any instance of "balloon".
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Character Counting**

The algorithm counts the frequency of each character in the string and checks if enough characters are available to form the word "balloon":

- **Initialization**:
  - Use a hash map to count the occurrences of each character in the string.

- **Forming "balloon"**:
  - Check if there are sufficient characters to form the word "balloon". Specifically, ensure there is at least one 'b', 'a', 'n', and two 'l' and 'o' characters.
  - Decrement the count of each character used to form "balloon" and increment the instance count.

- **Loop Until Possible**:
  - Continue forming "balloon" instances until there are insufficient characters to form another instance.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the string.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(1)** extra space due to the fixed size of the character set.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxNumberOfBalloons(string text) {
        unordered_map<char, int> charCount;
        for (char c : text) {
            charCount[c]++;
        }
        int count = 0;
        while (true) {
            if (charCount['b'] > 0 && charCount['a'] > 0 && charCount['l'] > 1 && charCount['o'] > 1 && charCount['n'] > 0) {
                charCount['b']--;
                charCount['a']--;
                charCount['l'] -= 2;
                charCount['o'] -= 2;
                charCount['n']--;
                count++;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{text.length} \leq 10^4 \)
- `text` consists of lowercase English letters only.

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently counts characters and checks for the formation of "balloon" using a hash map.
- The solution handles the constraints well and ensures that the result is accurate.
- The use of a hash map allows for a linear time complexity solution.
