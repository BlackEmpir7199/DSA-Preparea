# ðŸ”¢ **Max Number of K-Sum Pairs**

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, determine the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array. In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals `k` and remove them from the array.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to find the maximum number of operations that can be performed on the array.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation:
- Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2, 3]
- Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = []
There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [3, 1, 3, 4, 3], k = 6
Output: 1
Explanation:
- Remove the first two 3's, then nums = [1, 4, 3]
There are no more pairs that sum up to 6, hence a total of 1 operation.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Hash Map for Pair Counting**

The algorithm uses a hash map to efficiently count and match pairs:

- **Initialization**:
  - Use a hash map to store the frequency of each number in the array.

- **Pair Matching**:
  - Traverse the array and for each number, check if there exists a complement (i.e., `k - nums[i]`) in the hash map.
  - If a complement is found, increment the operation count and decrement the frequency of the complement in the map.
  - If no complement is found, increment the frequency of the current number in the map.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the array.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(n)** extra space for the hash map.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxOperations(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int cnt = 0;
        unordered_map<int, int> map;
        for (int i : nums) {
            if (map[k - i] != 0) {
                cnt++;
                map[k - i]--;
            } else {
                map[i]++;
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{nums.length} \leq 10^5 \)
- \( 1 \leq \text{nums}[i] \leq 10^9 \)
- \( 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently finds the maximum number of operations using a hash map to track complements.
- The solution handles large inputs effectively within the given constraints.
- The use of a hash map allows for a linear time complexity solution.
