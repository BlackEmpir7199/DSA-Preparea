# ðŸ”¢ **Intersection of Two Arrays II**

## Problem Description

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in any order.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to find the intersection of two arrays, where each element in the result appears as many times as it shows in both arrays.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9]
Explanation: [9,4] is also accepted.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Hashmap Approach**

The algorithm efficiently finds the intersection of two arrays using a hashmap:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a hashmap `mpp` to store the frequency of each element in `nums1`.
   - Use a vector `vc` to store the intersection results.

2. **Count Frequencies**:
   - Iterate through `nums1` and populate the hashmap `mpp` with the frequency of each element.

3. **Find Intersection**:
   - Iterate through `nums2` and for each element, check if it exists in the hashmap `mpp` with a frequency greater than 0.
   - If it does, add the element to the vector `vc` and decrement the frequency in the hashmap.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n + m)** time, where \( n \) and \( m \) are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(min(n, m))** extra space for the hashmap.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> intersect(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        unordered_map<int,int> mpp;
        vector<int> vc;
        for(int i:nums1) mpp[i]++;
        for(int i:nums2){
            if(mpp[i]>0){
                vc.push_back(i);
                mpp[i]--;
            }
        }
        return vc;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{nums1.length}, \text{nums2.length} \leq 1000 \)
- \( 0 \leq \text{nums1}[i], \text{nums2}[i] \leq 1000 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently finds the intersection of two arrays using a hashmap.
- The solution handles the input effectively within the given constraints.
- The use of a hashmap allows for a linear time complexity solution.
