# 967. Numbers With Same Consecutive Differences

## Problem Description
Given two integers `n` and `k`, return an array of all the integers of length `n` where the difference between every two consecutive digits is `k`. The answer can be returned in any order.

**Note**: The integers should not have leading zeros. Integers like `02` and `043` are not allowed.

### Examples
- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `n = 3`, `k = 7`
  - Output: `[181,292,707,818,929]`
  - Explanation: Note that `070` is not a valid number because it has leading zeros.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `n = 2`, `k = 1`
  - Output: `[10,12,21,23,32,34,43,45,54,56,65,67,76,78,87,89,98]`

### Constraints
- `2 <= n <= 9`
- `0 <= k <= 9`

## Approach
The solution uses a **backtracking** approach to generate all valid numbers of length `n` where the difference between consecutive digits is exactly `k`. 

### Key Steps:
1. **Initialization**: Start with digits from `1` to `9` (to avoid leading zeros).
2. **Recursive Helper Function**:
   - **Base Case**: If the remaining digits to form (`n`) is `0`, add the current number to the result list.
   - **Recursive Case**: For each digit from `0` to `9`, check if the absolute difference between the last digit of the current number and the new digit is `k`. If yes, append the new digit and proceed recursively.
3. **Backtracking**: After exploring a digit, backtrack by removing it to try other possibilities.

### Solution Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> ans;
    void helper(int num, int n, int k){
        if(n==0){
            ans.push_back(num);
            return;
        }
        for(int i=0;i<=9;i++){
            if(abs(num%10-i) == k){
                num = num*10 + i;
                helper(num,n-1,k);
                num = num/10;
            }
        }
    }
    vector<int> numsSameConsecDiff(int n, int k) {
        for(int i=1;i<10;i++){
            helper(i,n-1,k);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Explanation
1. **Initialization**: The function `numsSameConsecDiff` starts by iterating over the first digit (1 to 9) to avoid leading zeros.
2. **Recursive Construction**: The `helper` function constructs the number digit by digit. For each step, it checks if the next digit (0-9) has an absolute difference of `k` with the last digit of the current number.
3. **Base Case**: When the number reaches the desired length (`n`), it is added to the result list.
4. **Backtracking**: After exploring a digit, the function backtracks by removing the last digit to explore other valid digits.

This approach efficiently generates all valid numbers by leveraging recursion and backtracking, ensuring no leading zeros and all consecutive digits meet the difference condition.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: `O(2^n)` in the worst case, as each digit can branch into multiple possibilities.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(2^n)` for storing the result, plus the recursion stack space.

This method is optimal for the given constraints (`n` up to 9), as it systematically explores all valid combinations without redundancy.
