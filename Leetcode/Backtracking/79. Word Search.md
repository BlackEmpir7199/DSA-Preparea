# 79. Word Search 

## Problem Description

Given an `m x n` grid of characters `board` and a string `word`, return `true` if `word` exists in the grid. The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Write a function to determine if a word exists in a 2D board of characters.

## âœ¨ Example

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
Output: true
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE"
Output: true
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCB"
Output: false
```

## ðŸš€ Approach

### Backtracking with Recursion

The algorithm uses backtracking with recursion to search for the word in the 2D board:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a helper function `isSafe` to check if the current position is within the bounds of the board.
   - Use a helper function `helper` to perform the recursive search.

2. **Recursive Search**:
   - If the current position is not safe or the current character does not match the character in the word, return `false`.
   - If the entire word has been found, return `true`.
   - Mark the current cell as visited by temporarily changing its value to a special character (e.g., `#`).
   - Recursively search for the next character in the word in all four possible directions (up, down, left, right).
   - Restore the original value of the current cell before backtracking.

3. **Main Function**:
   - Iterate over each cell in the board and use the `helper` function to search for the word starting from that cell.
   - If the word is found starting from any cell, return `true`.
   - If the word is not found after searching all cells, return `false`.

### Time Complexity:
- The algorithm runs in **O(m * n * 4^L)** time, where `m` is the number of rows, `n` is the number of columns, and `L` is the length of the word. This is because, in the worst case, we might have to explore all four directions for each character in the word.

### Space Complexity:
- The algorithm uses **O(L)** extra space for the recursion stack, where `L` is the length of the word.

## ðŸ’¡ Code Implementation

### Backtracking with Recursion

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Solution {

    bool isSafe(vector<vector<char>>& board, string word, int i, int j, int row, int col, int k) {
        return (i >= 0 && j >= 0 && j < col && i < row);
    }

    bool helper(vector<vector<char>>& board, string word, int i, int j, int row, int col, int k) {

        if (!isSafe(board, word, i, j, row, col, k)) return false;

        if (word[k] != board[i][j]) return false;

        if (word.size() - 1 == k) return true;

        char temp = board[i][j];
        board[i][j] = '#';

        bool ans = helper(board, word, i + 1, j, row, col, k + 1) ||
                   helper(board, word, i, j + 1, row, col, k + 1) ||
                   helper(board, word, i - 1, j, row, col, k + 1) ||
                   helper(board, word, i, j - 1, row, col, k + 1);

        board[i][j] = temp;

        return ans;
    }

public:
    bool exist(vector<vector<char>>& board, string word) {
        int row = board.size();
        int col = board[0].size();

        if (word.length() > row * col) return false;

        for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < col; j++) {
                if (helper(board, word, i, j, row, col, 0)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ Constraints

- `m == board.length`
- `n = board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 6`
- `1 <= word.length <= 15`
- `board` and `word` contains only lowercase and uppercase English letters.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Points

- The algorithm uses backtracking with recursion to search for the word in the 2D board.
- The solution handles the input effectively within the given constraints.
- The recursive approach is straightforward and leverages the call stack to explore all possible paths.
