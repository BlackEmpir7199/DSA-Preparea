# ðŸŒ„ **Peak Index in a Mountain Array**

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `arr` of length `n`, representing a mountain array where:
- The values **increase** to a peak element and then **decrease**.
- Your task is to find the **index of the peak element** in the mountain array.

You must solve it in **O(log n)** time complexity.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Find the peak index of the mountain array, i.e., the index of the element that is strictly larger than its neighbors.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: arr = [0,1,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: The peak element is 1 at index 1.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: arr = [0,2,1,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: The peak element is 2 at index 1.
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: arr = [0,10,5,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The peak element is 10 at index 1.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Binary Search**:
Since the array forms a **mountain** (i.e., first increasing and then decreasing), we can leverage **binary search** to efficiently find the peak element in **O(log n)** time complexity.

- **First Condition**: If the middle element is greater than both its neighbors, then it is the peak.
- **Second Condition**: If the middle element is smaller than its left neighbor, then the peak lies in the **left half** of the array.
- **Third Condition**: If the middle element is smaller than its right neighbor, then the peak lies in the **right half** of the array.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(log n)** time due to the binary search approach, making it efficient for large arrays.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```java
class Solution {
    public int peakIndexInMountainArray(int[] arr) {
        return pseudoBinary(arr);
    }
    
    static int pseudoBinary(int[] arr){
        int start = 0;
        int end = arr.length - 1;
        int ans = -1;
        
        while (start < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            
            // Check if mid is a peak
            if (arr[mid - 1] > arr[mid]) {
                end = mid;
            } else {
                start = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return end - 1; // Return the index of the peak element
    }
}
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- `3 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= arr[i] <= 10^6`
- `arr` is guaranteed to be a **mountain array**, which means it has exactly one peak element.

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- **Binary Search** optimizes the search process, reducing time complexity to **O(log n)**.
- The array is a **mountain** so the peak element can be found by comparing its neighbors.
- Ensure to account for edge cases, such as arrays with the smallest valid length (`3`).
