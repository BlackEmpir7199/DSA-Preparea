# ðŸ”¢ **Search a 2D Matrix**

## Problem Description

Given an \( m \times n \) integer matrix with the following properties:
- Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Given an integer `target`, determine if the `target` is present in the matrix. The solution must have a time complexity of \( O(\log(m \times n)) \).

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to check if the `target` exists in the matrix.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: matrix = [[1, 3, 5, 7], [10, 11, 16, 20], [23, 30, 34, 60]], target = 3
Output: true
Explanation: The target 3 is present in the matrix.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: matrix = [[1, 3, 5, 7], [10, 11, 16, 20], [23, 30, 34, 60]], target = 13
Output: false
Explanation: The target 13 is not present in the matrix.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Binary Search on Flattened Matrix**

The algorithm efficiently searches for the target using binary search:

- **Initialization**:
  - Treat the matrix as a single sorted array by considering its flattened form.
  - Set the `low` and `high` pointers to represent the range of indices in this flattened array.

- **Binary Search**:
  - Calculate the middle index `mid` and convert it to row and column indices.
  - Compare the target with the element at the calculated row and column.
  - Adjust the search range based on the comparison result.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(log(m Ã— n))** time due to the binary search.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(1)** extra space.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool searchMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int target) {
        int n = matrix.size();
        int m = matrix[0].size();
        int low = 0, high = m * n - 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            int row = mid / m;
            int col = mid % m;
            if (matrix[row][col] == target)
                return true;
            else if (matrix[row][col] < target)
                low = mid + 1;
            else
                high = mid - 1;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( m == \text{matrix.length} \)
- \( n == \text{matrix}[i].length \)
- \( 1 \leq m, n \leq 100 \)
- \( -10^4 \leq \text{matrix}[i][j], \text{target} \leq 10^4 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently searches the matrix using binary search by treating it as a single sorted array.
- The solution handles the constraints well and ensures that the result is accurate.
- The use of binary search allows for a logarithmic time complexity solution.
