# ðŸ”¢ **Sqrt(x)**

## Problem Description

Given a non-negative integer `x`, return the square root of `x` rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator. For example, do not use `pow(x, 0.5)` in C++ or `x ** 0.5` in Python.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to compute the integer square root of a given non-negative integer `x`.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Binary Search Approach**

The algorithm efficiently finds the integer square root using binary search:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use two pointers, `low` and `high`, initialized to `0` and `x`, respectively.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - Calculate the middle point `mid` of the current range.
   - Check if `mid * mid` is less than or equal to `x`. If true, move the `low` pointer to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, move the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`.
   - Repeat the process until `low` exceeds `high`.

3. **Result**:
   - The `high` pointer will be at the position of the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to `x`.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(log x)** time.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(1)** extra space.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        int low = 0, high = x;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if ((long long)mid * mid <= x)
                low = mid + 1;
            else
                high = mid - 1;
        }
        return high;
    }
};
```
