# ðŸ”¢ **Valid Perfect Square**

## Problem Description

Given a positive integer `num`, return `true` if `num` is a perfect square or `false` otherwise.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

You must not use any built-in library function, such as `sqrt`.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to determine if a given number is a perfect square without using any built-in library functions.

## âœ¨ **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: num = 16
Output: true
Explanation: We return true because 4 * 4 = 16 and 4 is an integer.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: num = 14
Output: false
Explanation: We return false because 3.742 * 3.742 = 14 and 3.742 is not an integer.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Binary Search**

The algorithm uses binary search to efficiently determine if the number is a perfect square:

- **Initialization**:
  - Set the lower bound `low` to 1.
  - Set the upper bound `high` to `num`.

- **Binary Search**:
  - Calculate the midpoint `mid` of the current range.
  - If `mid * mid` is equal to `num`, return `true`.
  - If `mid * mid` is less than `num`, adjust the lower bound `low` to `mid + 1`.
  - If `mid * mid` is greater than `num`, adjust the upper bound `high` to `mid - 1`.

- **Termination**:
  - The loop terminates when `low` exceeds `high`, indicating that the number is not a perfect square.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(log n)** time, where \( n \) is the given number.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPerfectSquare(int num) {
        int low = 1, high = num;
        while (low <= high) {
            long long mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (mid * mid == num)
                return true;
            else if (mid * mid < num)
                low = mid + 1;
            else if (mid * mid > num)
                high = mid - 1;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{num} \leq 2^{31} - 1 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently determines if a number is a perfect square using binary search.
- The solution handles the constraints well and ensures that the number is accurately checked without using built-in functions.
- The use of binary search allows for an efficient determination of whether the number is a perfect square with **O(log n)** time complexity.
