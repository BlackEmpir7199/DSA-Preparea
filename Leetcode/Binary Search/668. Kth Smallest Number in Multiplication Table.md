# ðŸ”¢ **Kth Smallest Number in Multiplication Table**

## Problem Description

Given three integers `m`, `n`, and `k`, return the `k-th` smallest element in the `m x n` multiplication table. The multiplication table of size `m x n` is an integer matrix `mat` where `mat[i][j] == i * j` (1-indexed).

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to find the `k-th` smallest element in the `m x n` multiplication table.

## âœ¨ **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: m = 3, n = 3, k = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: The 5th smallest number is 3.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: m = 2, n = 3, k = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The 6th smallest number is 6.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Binary Search**

The algorithm uses binary search to find the `k-th` smallest element efficiently:

- **Initialization**:
  - Set the lower bound `low` to 1.
  - Set the upper bound `high` to `m * n`.

- **Binary Search**:
  - Calculate the midpoint `mid` of the current range.
  - Use a helper function `isSmall` to check if there are at least `k` elements in the multiplication table that are less than or equal to `mid`.
  - Adjust the search range based on the result of `isSmall`.

- **Count Calculation**:
  - Traverse the rows of the multiplication table and count the number of elements that are less than or equal to `mid`.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(m log(mn))** time, where \( m \) is the number of rows and \( n \) is the number of columns in the multiplication table.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
    bool isSmall(int mid, int k, int m, int n) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            int add = min(mid / i, n);
            if (add == 0) break;
            count += add;
        }
        return count >= k;
    }

public:
    int findKthNumber(int m, int n, int k) {
        int low = 1;
        int high = m * n;
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (isSmall(mid, k, m, n))
                high = mid;
            else
                low = mid + 1;
        }
        return low;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq m, n \leq 3 \times 10^4 \)
- \( 1 \leq k \leq m \times n \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently finds the `k-th` smallest element using binary search and a counting function.
- The solution handles the constraints well and ensures that the count of elements is accurately calculated.
- The use of binary search allows for an efficient determination of the `k-th` smallest element.
