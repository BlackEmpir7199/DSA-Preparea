# ðŸšŒ **Minimum Time to Complete Trips**

## Problem Description

You are given an array `time` where `time[i]` denotes the time taken by the `i-th` bus to complete one trip. Each bus can make multiple trips successively, and each bus operates independently.

You are also given an integer `totalTrips`, which denotes the number of trips all buses should make in total. Return the minimum time required for all buses to complete at least `totalTrips` trips.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to determine the minimum time required for all buses to complete at least `totalTrips` trips.

## âœ¨ **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: time = [1, 2, 3], totalTrips = 5
Output: 3
Explanation:
- At time t = 1, the number of trips completed by each bus are [1, 0, 0].
  The total number of trips completed is 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.
- At time t = 2, the number of trips completed by each bus are [2, 1, 0].
  The total number of trips completed is 2 + 1 + 0 = 3.
- At time t = 3, the number of trips completed by each bus are [3, 1, 1].
  The total number of trips completed is 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.
So the minimum time needed for all buses to complete at least 5 trips is 3.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: time = [2], totalTrips = 1
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is only one bus, and it will complete its first trip at t = 2.
So the minimum time needed to complete 1 trip is 2.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Binary Search**

The algorithm uses binary search to find the minimum time required:

- **Initialization**:
  - Set the lower bound `low` to the minimum value in `time`.
  - Set the upper bound `high` to the product of the minimum value in `time` and `totalTrips`.

- **Binary Search**:
  - Calculate the midpoint `mid` of the current range.
  - Use a helper function `canTrip` to check if it's possible to complete at least `totalTrips` trips within `mid` time.
  - Adjust the search range based on the result of `canTrip`.

- **Trip Calculation**:
  - Traverse the `time` array and calculate the total number of trips that can be completed within `mid` time.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n log T)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the `time` array and \( T \) is the range of possible times.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
    bool canTrip(vector<int>& nums, long long mid, int total) {
        long long ans = 0;
        for (int i : nums)
            ans += (mid / i);
        return ans >= total;
    }

public:
    long long minimumTime(vector<int>& time, int totalTrips) {
        long long low = *min_element(time.begin(), time.end());
        long long high = low * totalTrips;
        while (low <= high) {
            long long mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (canTrip(time, mid, totalTrips))
                high = mid - 1;
            else
                low = mid + 1;
        }
        return low;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{time.length} \leq 10^5 \)
- \( 1 \leq \text{time}[i], \text{totalTrips} \leq 10^7 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently finds the minimum time using binary search and a counting function.
- The solution handles the constraints well and ensures that the total number of trips is accurately calculated.
- The use of binary search allows for an efficient determination of the minimum time required.
