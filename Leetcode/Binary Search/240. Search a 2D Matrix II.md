# üîç **Search a 2D Matrix II**

## Problem Description

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value `target` in an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix`. This matrix has the following properties:

- Integers in each row are sorted in ascending order from left to right.
- Integers in each column are sorted in ascending order from top to bottom.

## üéØ **Objective**

Write a function to determine if the `target` value exists in the matrix.

## ‚ú® **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: matrix = [
    [1, 4, 7, 11, 15],
    [2, 5, 8, 12, 19],
    [3, 6, 9, 16, 22],
    [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
    [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
], target = 5
Output: true
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: matrix = [
    [1, 4, 7, 11, 15],
    [2, 5, 8, 12, 19],
    [3, 6, 9, 16, 22],
    [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
    [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
], target = 20
Output: false
```

## üöÄ **Approach**

### **Two-Pointer Technique**

The algorithm uses a two-pointer technique to efficiently search for the target value:

- **Initialization**:
  - Start with the pointer `row` at the first row and `col` at the last column.

- **Search**:
  - If the current element `matrix[row][col]` is equal to the target, return `true`.
  - If the current element is less than the target, move to the next row (`row++`).
  - If the current element is greater than the target, move to the previous column (`col--`).

- **Termination**:
  - The loop terminates when the pointers go out of bounds, indicating that the target is not found.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(m + n)** time, where \( m \) is the number of rows and \( n \) is the number of columns in the matrix.

## üí° **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool searchMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int target) {
        int n = matrix.size();
        int m = matrix[0].size();
        int row = 0, col = m - 1;
        while (row < n && col >= 0) {
            if (matrix[row][col] == target)
                return true;
            else if (matrix[row][col] < target)
                row++;
            else
                col--;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

## üîß **Constraints**

- \( m == \text{matrix.length} \)
- \( n == \text{matrix}[i].length \)
- \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 300 \)
- \( -10^9 \leq \text{matrix}[i][j] \leq 10^9 \)
- All the integers in each row are sorted in ascending order.
- All the integers in each column are sorted in ascending order.
- \( -10^9 \leq \text{target} \leq 10^9 \)

## üåü **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently searches for the target value using a two-pointer technique.
- The solution handles the constraints well and ensures that the search is performed in linear time.
- The use of two pointers allows for an efficient traversal of the matrix.
