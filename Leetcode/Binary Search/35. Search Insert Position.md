# 35. Search Insert Position üîç

Welcome to the **Search Insert Position** repository! This project provides an efficient solution to find the index where a target value should be inserted in a sorted array of distinct integers. This problem is a great way to practice binary search and understand its application in solving problems with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

## Problem Statement üìú

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** `nums = [1,3,5,6]`, `target = 5`
- **Output:** `2`
- **Explanation:** The target value `5` is found at index `2`.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** `nums = [1,3,5,6]`, `target = 2`
- **Output:** `1`
- **Explanation:** The target value `2` is not found, but it would be inserted at index `1`.

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** `nums = [1,3,5,6]`, `target = 7`
- **Output:** `4`
- **Explanation:** The target value `7` is not found, but it would be inserted at index `4`.

### Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `nums` contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
- `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4`

## Solution Code üíª

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int searchInsert(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int low = 0, high = nums.size() - 1;
        int mini = high + 1;
        while (high >= low) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] >= target) {
                mini = mid;
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return mini;
    }
};
```

## Explanation üß†

1. **Initialization:**
   - We initialize two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - We also initialize `mini` to `high + 1`, which will store the potential insert position.

2. **Binary Search:**
   - We perform a binary search to find the target or the correct insert position.
   - Calculate the middle index `mid` using `low + (high - low) / 2` to avoid overflow.
   - If `nums[mid]` is greater than or equal to the target, update `mini` to `mid` and search the left half by setting `high = mid - 1`.
   - Otherwise, search the right half by setting `low = mid + 1`.

3. **Return the Result:**
   - After the loop, `mini` will hold the index where the target should be inserted or where it is found.

## Time and Space Complexity ‚è≥

- **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)`, where `n` is the length of the array. We use binary search to achieve this.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
