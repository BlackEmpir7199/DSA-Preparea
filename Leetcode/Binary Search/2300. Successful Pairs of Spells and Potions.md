# ðŸ”® **Successful Pairs of Spells and Potions**

## Problem Description

You are given two positive integer arrays, `spells` and `potions`, of lengths \( n \) and \( m \) respectively. Each element `spells[i]` represents the strength of the \( i \)-th spell, and each element `potions[j]` represents the strength of the \( j \)-th potion. You are also given an integer `success`.

A spell and potion pair is considered successful if the product of their strengths is at least `success`. Your task is to determine the number of successful pairs for each spell and return an array `pairs` where `pairs[i]` is the number of potions that form a successful pair with the \( i \)-th spell.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to calculate the number of successful pairs for each spell.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: spells = [5, 1, 3], potions = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], success = 7
Output: [4, 0, 3]
Explanation:
- 0th spell: 5 * [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]. 4 pairs are successful.
- 1st spell: 1 * [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. 0 pairs are successful.
- 2nd spell: 3 * [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15]. 3 pairs are successful.
Thus, [4, 0, 3] is returned.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: spells = [3, 1, 2], potions = [8, 5, 8], success = 16
Output: [2, 0, 2]
Explanation:
- 0th spell: 3 * [8, 5, 8] = [24, 15, 24]. 2 pairs are successful.
- 1st spell: 1 * [8, 5, 8] = [8, 5, 8]. 0 pairs are successful.
- 2nd spell: 2 * [8, 5, 8] = [16, 10, 16]. 2 pairs are successful.
Thus, [2, 0, 2] is returned.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Binary Search with Sorting**

The algorithm efficiently finds the number of successful pairs using binary search:

- **Initialization**:
  - Sort the `potions` array to facilitate binary search.

- **Binary Search for Each Spell**:
  - For each spell, determine the minimum potion strength required to achieve a successful pair.
  - Use binary search to find the index of the first potion that, when multiplied by the spell strength, meets or exceeds the `success` threshold.
  - The number of successful pairs for the spell is the count of potions from this index to the end of the array.

### **Time Complexity**:
- Sorting the `potions` array takes **O(m log m)** time.
- Binary search for each spell takes **O(log m)** time, resulting in an overall time complexity of **O(n log m)**.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> successfulPairs(vector<int>& spells, vector<int>& potions, long long success) {
        vector<int> vc;
        int n = potions.size();
        sort(potions.begin(), potions.end());
        for (int s : spells) {
            int i = 0, j = n - 1;
            int ind = n;
            while (i <= j) {
                int mid = i + (j - i) / 2;
                if ((long long)potions[mid] * s >= success) {
                    j = mid - 1;
                    ind = mid;
                } else {
                    i = mid + 1;
                }
            }
            vc.push_back(n - ind);
        }
        return vc;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( n == \text{spells.length} \)
- \( m == \text{potions.length} \)
- \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5 \)
- \( 1 \leq \text{spells}[i], \text{potions}[i] \leq 10^5 \)
- \( 1 \leq \text{success} \leq 10^{10} \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently calculates the number of successful pairs using binary search.
- Sorting the `potions` array allows for quick lookup of the minimum required potion strength.
- The solution handles large inputs effectively within the given constraints.
