# ðŸŒ¸ **Minimum Number of Days to Make m Bouquets**

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `bloomDay`, an integer `m`, and an integer `k`. You want to make `m` bouquets, and to make a bouquet, you need to use `k` adjacent flowers from the garden. The garden consists of `n` flowers, where the `i-th` flower will bloom on `bloomDay[i]` and can be used in exactly one bouquet.

Return the minimum number of days you need to wait to be able to make `m` bouquets from the garden. If it is impossible to make `m` bouquets, return `-1`.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to determine the minimum number of days required to make `m` bouquets, each consisting of `k` adjacent flowers.

## âœ¨ **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: bloomDay = [1, 10, 3, 10, 2], m = 3, k = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: Let's see what happened in the first three days. x means flower bloomed and _ means flower did not bloom in the garden.
We need 3 bouquets, each should contain 1 flower.
After day 1: [x, _, _, _, _]   // we can only make one bouquet.
After day 2: [x, _, _, _, x]   // we can only make two bouquets.
After day 3: [x, _, x, _, x]   // we can make 3 bouquets. The answer is 3.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: bloomDay = [1, 10, 3, 10, 2], m = 3, k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: We need 3 bouquets, each with 2 flowers, which means we need 6 flowers. We only have 5 flowers, so it is impossible to get the needed bouquets, and we return -1.
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: bloomDay = [7, 7, 7, 7, 12, 7, 7], m = 2, k = 3
Output: 12
Explanation: We need 2 bouquets, each should have 3 flowers.
Here is the garden after the 7th and 12th days:
After day 7: [x, x, x, x, _, x, x]
We can make one bouquet of the first three flowers that bloomed. We cannot make another bouquet from the last three flowers that bloomed because they are not adjacent.
After day 12: [x, x, x, x, x, x, x]
It is obvious that we can make two bouquets in different ways.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Binary Search with Counting**

The algorithm uses binary search to find the minimum number of days required:

- **Initialization**:
  - Set the lower bound `low` to the minimum value in `bloomDay`.
  - Set the upper bound `high` to the maximum value in `bloomDay`.

- **Binary Search**:
  - Calculate the midpoint `mid` of the current range.
  - Use a helper function `cntIfPos` to check if it's possible to make `m` bouquets with `k` adjacent flowers within `mid` days.
  - Adjust the search range based on the result of `cntIfPos`.

- **Counting Bouquets**:
  - Traverse the `bloomDay` array and count the number of bouquets that can be made with the current `mid` value.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n log D)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the `bloomDay` array and \( D \) is the range of possible bloom days.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
    int cntIfPos(vector<int>& arr, int mid, int k, int m) {
        int cnt = 0, ans = 0;
        for (int i : arr) {
            if (i <= mid)
                cnt += 1;
            else {
                ans += cnt / k;
                cnt = 0;
            }
        }
        ans += cnt / k;
        return ans >= m;
    }

public:
    int minDays(vector<int>& arr, int m, int k) {
        long long val = m * 1ll * k * 1ll;
        int n = arr.size();
        if (val > n) return -1;
        int high = *max_element(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        int low = *min_element(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            if (cntIfPos(arr, mid, k, m)) {
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return low;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( \text{bloomDay.length} == n \)
- \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)
- \( 1 \leq \text{bloomDay}[i] \leq 10^9 \)
- \( 1 \leq m \leq 10^6 \)
- \( 1 \leq k \leq n \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently finds the minimum number of days using binary search and a counting function.
- The solution handles the constraints well and ensures that the bouquets are accurately counted.
- The use of binary search allows for an efficient determination of the minimum days required.
