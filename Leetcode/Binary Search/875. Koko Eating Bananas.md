# 🍌 **Koko Eating Bananas**

## Problem Description

Koko loves to eat bananas, and there are \( n \) piles of bananas. The \( i \)-th pile has `piles[i]` bananas. The guards are away for \( h \) hours, and Koko wants to eat all the bananas before they return.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed \( k \). Each hour, she eats \( k \) bananas from a pile of her choice. If a pile has fewer than \( k \) bananas, she eats all of them and doesn't eat more bananas during that hour.

Your task is to determine the minimum integer \( k \) such that Koko can eat all the bananas within \( h \) hours.

## 🎯 **Objective**

Write a function to find the minimum eating speed \( k \) that allows Koko to finish all the bananas within the given time frame.

## ✨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: piles = [3, 6, 7, 11], h = 8
Output: 4
Explanation: Koko can eat all the bananas within 8 hours at a speed of 4 bananas per hour.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: piles = [30, 11, 23, 4, 20], h = 5
Output: 30
Explanation: The minimum speed to eat all bananas in 5 hours is 30 bananas per hour.
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: piles = [30, 11, 23, 4, 20], h = 6
Output: 23
Explanation: The minimum speed to eat all bananas in 6 hours is 23 bananas per hour.
```

## 🚀 **Approach**

### **Binary Search for Minimum Speed**

The algorithm uses binary search to find the minimum eating speed:

- **Initialization**:
  - Set the lower bound `low` to 1 (the minimum possible speed).
  - Set the upper bound `high` to the maximum number of bananas in any pile (the maximum possible speed).

- **Binary Search**:
  - Calculate the midpoint `mid` of the current range.
  - Use a helper function `getHour` to determine the total hours required to eat all bananas at speed `mid`.
  - Adjust the search range based on whether the total hours exceed \( h \).

- **Feasibility Check**:
  - Calculate the number of hours needed to eat each pile at the current speed.
  - Sum the hours for all piles and compare with \( h \).

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n log(max(piles)))** time, where \( n \) is the number of piles.

## 💡 **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
    long long getHour(vector<int>& arr, int mid) {
        long long ct = 0;
        for (int i : arr) {
            ct += (i + mid - 1) / mid;
        }
        return ct;
    }

public:
    int minEatingSpeed(vector<int>& piles, int h) {
        int low = 1, high = *max_element(piles.begin(), piles.end());
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            long long hr = getHour(piles, mid);
            if (hr > h)
                low = mid + 1;
            else
                high = mid - 1;
        }
        return low;
    }
};
```

## 🔧 **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{piles.length} \leq 10^4 \)
- \( \text{piles.length} \leq h \leq 10^9 \)
- \( 1 \leq \text{piles}[i] \leq 10^9 \)

## 🌟 **Key Points**

- The binary search efficiently narrows down the minimum eating speed.
- The feasibility check ensures that Koko can finish all bananas within the given hours.
- The solution handles large inputs effectively within the given constraints.
