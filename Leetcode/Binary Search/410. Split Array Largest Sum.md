# ðŸ”¢ **Split Array Largest Sum**

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, split `nums` into `k` non-empty subarrays such that the largest sum of any subarray is minimized. Your task is to return the minimized largest sum of the split.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to determine the minimum possible value of the maximum sum of the subarrays when `nums` is split into `k` subarrays.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [7, 2, 5, 10, 8], k = 2
Output: 18
Explanation: The best way to split the array into two subarrays is [7, 2, 5] and [10, 8], where the largest sum among the two subarrays is 18.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 2
Output: 9
Explanation: The best way to split the array into two subarrays is [1, 2, 3] and [4, 5], where the largest sum among the two subarrays is 9.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Binary Search with Feasibility Check**

The algorithm uses binary search to find the minimum possible largest sum:

- **Initialization**:
  - Set the lower bound `low` as the maximum element in `nums` (the minimum possible largest sum).
  - Set the upper bound `high` as the sum of all elements in `nums` (the maximum possible largest sum).

- **Binary Search**:
  - Calculate the midpoint `mid` of the current range.
  - Use a helper function `getCount` to determine if it's possible to split `nums` into `k` subarrays such that the largest sum is at most `mid`.
  - Adjust the search range based on the feasibility check.

- **Feasibility Check**:
  - Traverse the array and simulate splitting it into subarrays with the maximum sum constraint `mid`.
  - Count the number of subarrays formed. If the count exceeds `k`, adjust the search range accordingly.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n log(sum(nums)))** time, where \( n \) is the length of the array.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
    int getCount(vector<int>& arr, int mid) {
        long long sum = 0;
        int count = 1;
        for (int i : arr) {
            if (i + sum <= mid)
                sum += i;
            else {
                sum = i;
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

public:
    int splitArray(vector<int>& boards, int k) {
        int n = boards.size();
        if (n < k) return -1;
        int low = *max_element(boards.begin(), boards.end());
        int high = accumulate(boards.begin(), boards.end(), 0);
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            int cnt = getCount(boards, mid);
            if (cnt > k)
                low = mid + 1;
            else
                high = mid - 1;
        }
        return low;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{nums.length} \leq 1000 \)
- \( 0 \leq \text{nums}[i] \leq 10^6 \)
- \( 1 \leq k \leq \min(50, \text{nums.length}) \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The binary search efficiently narrows down the minimum possible largest sum.
- The feasibility check ensures that the array can be split into the required number of subarrays.
- The solution handles large inputs effectively within the given constraints.
