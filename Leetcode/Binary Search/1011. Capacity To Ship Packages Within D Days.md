# ðŸš¢ **Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days**

## Problem Description

You are given an array of package weights and a number of days. Your task is to determine the minimum weight capacity of a ship that can transport all the packages within the specified number of days. The packages must be shipped in the order given, and the ship can make only one trip per day.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to find the minimum weight capacity of the ship that allows all packages to be shipped within the given number of days.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: weights = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], days = 5
Output: 15
Explanation: A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: weights = [3, 2, 2, 4, 1, 4], days = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days.
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: weights = [1, 2, 3, 1, 1], days = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: A ship capacity of 3 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 4 days.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Binary Search with Feasibility Check**

The algorithm uses binary search to find the minimum capacity:

- **Initialization**:
  - Set the lower bound `low` to the maximum weight in the `weights` array (the minimum possible capacity).
  - Set the upper bound `high` to the sum of all weights (the maximum possible capacity).

- **Binary Search**:
  - Calculate the midpoint `mid` of the current range.
  - Use a helper function `getWeight` to determine if it's possible to ship all packages within `days` using a capacity of `mid`.
  - Adjust the search range based on the feasibility check.

- **Feasibility Check**:
  - Traverse the weights array and simulate loading the ship with the given capacity.
  - Count the number of days required to ship all packages with the current capacity.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n log(sum(weights)))** time, where \( n \) is the length of the weights array.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
    int getWeight(vector<int>& weights, int mid) {
        int cnt = 1, sum = weights[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < weights.size(); i++) {
            if (sum + weights[i] > mid) {
                sum = 0;
                cnt++;
            }
            sum += weights[i];
        }
        return cnt;
    }

public:
    int shipWithinDays(vector<int>& weights, int days) {
        int low = *max_element(weights.begin(), weights.end());
        int high = accumulate(weights.begin(), weights.end(), 0);
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            int getw = getWeight(weights, mid);
            if (getw <= days)
                high = mid - 1;
            else
                low = mid + 1;
        }
        return low;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{days} \leq \text{weights.length} \leq 5 \times 10^4 \)
- \( 1 \leq \text{weights}[i] \leq 500 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The binary search efficiently narrows down the minimum possible capacity.
- The feasibility check ensures that the packages can be shipped within the given number of days.
- The solution handles large inputs effectively within the given constraints.
