# 🔍 **First Bad Version**

## Problem Description

You are a product manager leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether the version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

## 🎯 **Objective**

Write a function to find the first bad version using the minimum number of API calls.

## ✨ **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: n = 1, bad = 1
Output: 1
```

## 🚀 **Approach**

### **Binary Search**

The algorithm uses binary search to find the first bad version efficiently:

- **Initialization**:
  - Set the lower bound `low` to 1.
  - Set the upper bound `high` to `n`.

- **Binary Search**:
  - Calculate the midpoint `mid` of the current range.
  - If `isBadVersion(mid)` returns `true`, adjust the upper bound `high` to `mid`.
  - Otherwise, adjust the lower bound `low` to `mid + 1`.

- **Termination**:
  - The loop terminates when `low` equals `high`, which gives the first bad version.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(log n)** time, where \( n \) is the number of versions.

## 💡 **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int low = 1;
        int high = n;
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (isBadVersion(mid))
                high = mid;
            else
                low = mid + 1;
        }
        return low;
    }
};
```

## 🔧 **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{bad} \leq n \leq 2^{31} - 1 \)

## 🌟 **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently finds the first bad version using binary search.
- The solution minimizes the number of API calls and ensures that the first bad version is accurately determined.
- The use of binary search allows for an efficient determination of the first bad version with **O(log n)** time complexity.
