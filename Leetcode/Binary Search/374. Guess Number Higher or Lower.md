# ðŸŽ¯ **Guess Number Higher or Lower**

## Problem Description

You are playing the "Guess Game." The rules are as follows:

- You need to guess a number between 1 and \( n \).
- You have access to a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which provides feedback on your guess:
  - `-1`: Your guess is higher than the picked number.
  - `1`: Your guess is lower than the picked number.
  - `0`: Your guess is correct.

Your task is to determine the number that was picked by using the API efficiently.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to guess the number using the minimum number of guesses.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Binary Search**

The algorithm uses binary search to efficiently guess the number:

- **Initialization**:
  - Set two pointers, `i` and `j`, to represent the lower and upper bounds of the search range, initially 1 and \( n \).

- **Binary Search Loop**:
  - Calculate the midpoint `mid` of the current range.
  - Use the `guess` API to determine if `mid` is the correct number, higher, or lower.
  - Adjust the search range based on the feedback:
    - If `guess(mid)` returns `0`, `mid` is the correct number.
    - If `guess(mid)` returns `1`, the picked number is higher, so adjust `i` to `mid + 1`.
    - If `guess(mid)` returns `-1`, the picked number is lower, so adjust `j` to `mid - 1`.

- **Termination**:
  - The loop continues until `i` exceeds `j`, at which point the correct number is found.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(log n)** time due to the binary search method.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
/**
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param  num   your guess
 * @return       -1 if num is higher than the picked number
 *                1 if num is lower than the picked number
 *               otherwise return 0
 * int guess(int num);
 */

class Solution {
public:
    int guessNumber(int n) {
        int i = 1, j = n;
        while (i <= j) {
            int mid = i + (j - i) / 2;
            if (guess(mid) == 0)
                return mid;
            else if (guess(mid) == 1)
                i = mid + 1;
            else
                j = mid - 1;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq n \leq 2^{31} - 1 \)
- \( 1 \leq \text{pick} \leq n \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The binary search algorithm efficiently narrows down the possible range of the picked number.
- The solution minimizes the number of guesses required to find the correct number.
- The use of the `guess` API provides feedback to adjust the search range dynamically.
