# ðŸ”¢ **Find the Smallest Divisor Given a Threshold**

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `threshold`, we need to choose a positive integer divisor, divide all the elements of the array by it, and sum the results of the division. The goal is to find the smallest divisor such that the sum of the division results is less than or equal to the `threshold`.

Each result of the division is rounded up to the nearest integer greater than or equal to that element. For example, \( \frac{7}{3} = 3 \) and \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \).

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to find the smallest divisor that satisfies the given condition.

## âœ¨ **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1, 2, 5, 9], threshold = 6
Output: 5
Explanation: We can get a sum of 17 (1+2+5+9) if the divisor is 1.
If the divisor is 4, we get a sum of 7 (1+1+2+3).
If the divisor is 5, the sum will be 5 (1+1+1+2).
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [44, 22, 33, 11, 1], threshold = 5
Output: 44
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Binary Search**

The algorithm uses binary search to find the smallest divisor:

- **Initialization**:
  - Set the lower bound `low` to 1.
  - Set the upper bound `high` to the maximum value in `nums`.

- **Binary Search**:
  - Calculate the midpoint `mid` of the current range.
  - Use a helper function `getCount` to calculate the sum of the division results with the current `mid` value.
  - Adjust the search range based on the result of `getCount`.

- **Sum Calculation**:
  - Traverse the `nums` array and calculate the sum of the division results, rounding up each result.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n log D)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the `nums` array and \( D \) is the range of possible divisors.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
    int getCount(vector<int>& nums, int mid) {
        double sum = 0;
        for (int i : nums)
            sum += ceil((double)i / mid);
        return (int)sum;
    }

public:
    int smallestDivisor(vector<int>& nums, int threshold) {
        int low = 1;
        int high = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            int cnt = getCount(nums, mid);
            if (cnt <= threshold)
                high = mid - 1;
            else
                low = mid + 1;
        }
        return low;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{nums.length} \leq 5 \times 10^4 \)
- \( 1 \leq \text{nums}[i] \leq 10^6 \)
- \( \text{nums.length} \leq \text{threshold} \leq 10^6 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently finds the smallest divisor using binary search and a counting function.
- The solution handles the constraints well and ensures that the sum of the division results is accurately calculated.
- The use of binary search allows for an efficient determination of the smallest divisor.
