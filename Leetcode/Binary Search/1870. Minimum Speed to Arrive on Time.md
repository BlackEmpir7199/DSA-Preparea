# ðŸš† **Minimum Speed to Arrive on Time**

## Problem Description

You are given a list of distances `dist` that a train needs to travel sequentially, and a total time `hour` in which it must complete the journey. The train's speed can be chosen such that it travels at a constant speed for each segment, but after each segment, it must wait until the next integer hour before departing again (except for the last segment).

The goal is to find the **minimum positive integer speed** (in km/h) such that the train arrives on time. If it's impossible, return `-1`.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to determine the minimum speed required for the train to arrive on time or return `-1` if it's impossible.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: dist = [1,3,2], hour = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: At speed 1:
- Travel 1 km in 1 hour.
- Wait until the 2nd hour, then travel 3 km in 3 hours.
- Wait until the 6th hour, then travel 2 km in 2 hours.
Total time = 1 + 1 + 3 + 0 + 2 = 6 hours (on time).
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: dist = [1,3,2], hour = 2.7
Output: 3
Explanation: At speed 3:
- Travel 1 km in 1/3 hour (0.333 hours).
- No wait, travel 3 km in 1 hour.
- No wait, travel 2 km in 2/3 hour (0.666 hours).
Total time = 0.333 + 1 + 0.666 â‰ˆ 2 hours (on time).
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: dist = [1,3,2], hour = 1.9
Output: -1
Explanation: It's impossible to arrive on time with any speed.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Binary Search Approach**

The provided solution uses binary search to efficiently determine the minimum speed:

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - If the total required time (`hour`) is less than the number of segments minus one, it's impossible to arrive on time (since each segment except the last requires at least 1 hour), so return `-1`.

2. **Binary Search Setup**:
   - **Search Space**: The speed can range from `1` to a very large number (here, `INT_MAX` is used for simplicity).
   - **Objective**: Find the smallest speed `mid` such that the total time taken is â‰¤ `hour`.

3. **Validation Function**:
   - For a given speed `mid`, compute the total time taken:
     - For each segment except the last, time taken is `ceil(distance / speed)` (due to waiting for the next integer hour).
     - For the last segment, time taken is `distance / speed` (no waiting needed).
   - If the total time â‰¤ `hour`, it's a valid speed; otherwise, it's invalid.

4. **Binary Search Execution**:
   - Adjust the search space based on whether the current `mid` speed is valid:
     - If valid, search for a smaller speed (`right = mid - 1`).
     - If invalid, search for a larger speed (`left = mid + 1`).

### **Time Complexity**:
- The binary search runs in **O(log N)** time, where `N` is the range of possible speeds.
- The validation function runs in **O(M)** time, where `M` is the number of segments.
- Overall: **O(M log N)**.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(1)** extra space.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isValid(vector<int>& dist, double hour, double mid) {
        double totalHrs = 0;
        int i = 0;
        for (i = 0; i < dist.size() - 1; i++) {
            totalHrs += ceil(dist[i] / mid);
        }
        totalHrs += dist[i] / mid;
        return totalHrs <= hour;
    }

    int minSpeedOnTime(vector<int>& dist, double hour) {
        if (hour <= dist.size() - 1) {
            return -1;
        }
        int left = 1;
        int right = INT_MAX;
        int ans = -1;

        while (left <= right) {
            double mid = left + (right - left) / 2.0;
            if (isValid(dist, hour, mid)) {
                ans = mid;
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- `1 <= dist.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= dist[i] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= hour <= 10^9`
- There will be at most `10^5` segments.

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The binary search efficiently narrows down the possible speeds.
- The `isValid` function checks if a given speed allows the train to arrive on time.
- Edge cases (e.g., impossible scenarios) are handled upfront for optimization.
- The solution ensures optimal performance even for large input sizes.
