# ðŸ”¢ **Kth Missing Positive Number**

## Problem Description

Given a sorted array `arr` of positive integers in strictly increasing order and an integer `k`, find the `k`-th missing positive integer.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to determine the `k`-th missing positive integer from the array.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: arr = [2, 3, 4, 7, 11], k = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, ...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5, 6, 7, ...]. The 2nd missing positive integer is 6.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Binary Search for Efficient Missing Count**

The algorithm efficiently finds the `k`-th missing positive integer using binary search:

- **Initialization**:
  - Use binary search to find the position in the array where the count of missing numbers up to that point is just below `k`.

- **Binary Search**:
  - Calculate the number of missing integers before the middle element `mid` using the formula `arr[mid] - (mid + 1)`.
  - Adjust the search range based on whether the count of missing numbers is less than `k`.

- **Calculate Missing Number**:
  - Once the correct position is found, calculate the `k`-th missing number by adding `k` to the index `low`.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(log n)** time due to the binary search, where \( n \) is the length of the array.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(1)** extra space.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findKthPositive(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        int low = 0, high = arr.size() - 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            int miss = arr[mid] - (mid + 1);
            if (miss < k)
                low = mid + 1;
            else
                high = mid - 1;
        }
        return low + k;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{arr.length} \leq 1000 \)
- \( 1 \leq \text{arr}[i] \leq 1000 \)
- \( 1 \leq k \leq 1000 \)
- \( \text{arr}[i] < \text{arr}[j] \) for \( 1 \leq i < j \leq \text{arr.length} \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently finds the `k`-th missing positive integer using binary search.
- The solution handles the constraints well and ensures that the result is accurate.
- The use of binary search allows for a logarithmic time complexity solution.
