â€‹# 485. Max Consecutive Ones

**LeetCode Problem Link:** [Max Consecutive Ones](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/)

## Problem Description

Given a binary array `nums`, return the maximum number of consecutive `1`'s in the array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.

## Solution

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array while maintaining a count of consecutive `1`s. Whenever we encounter a `0`, we reset the count. Throughout the iteration, we keep track of the maximum count of consecutive `1`s encountered.

**Java Implementation:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums) {
        int maxCount = 0;
        int currentCount = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == 1) {
                currentCount++;
                maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, currentCount);
            } else {
                currentCount = 0;
            }
        }
        return maxCount;
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initialization:** We initialize `maxCount` to store the maximum number of consecutive `1`s found and `currentCount` to count the current streak of `1`s.
- **Iteration:** As we iterate through each element in `nums`:
  - If the element is `1`, we increment `currentCount` and update `maxCount` if `currentCount` exceeds `maxCount`.
  - If the element is `0`, we reset `currentCount` to `0` since the streak of consecutive `1`s has been broken.
- **Result:** After completing the iteration, `maxCount` contains the length of the longest consecutive sequence of `1`s.

**Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the array `nums`. We traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1). We use a constant amount of extra space.

This approach ensures an efficient solution to finding the maximum number of consecutive `1`s in a binary array.
