# 🔢 **Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted**

## Problem Description

Given a 1-indexed array of integers `numbers` that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.

Return the indices of the two numbers, `index1` and `index2`, added by one as an integer array `[index1, index2]` of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

## 🎯 **Objective**

Write a function to find the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.

## ✨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [1, 2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: numbers = [2, 3, 4], target = 6
Output: [1, 3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: numbers = [-1, 0], target = -1
Output: [1, 2]
Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
```

## 🚀 **Approach**

### **Two-Pointer Technique**

The algorithm efficiently finds the two numbers using a two-pointer technique:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, initialized to the start and end of the array, respectively.

2. **Two-Pointer Traversal**:
   - Calculate the sum of the elements at the `left` and `right` pointers.
   - If the sum equals the target, return the indices `[left + 1, right + 1]`.
   - If the sum is less than the target, increment the `left` pointer to increase the sum.
   - If the sum is greater than the target, decrement the `right` pointer to decrease the sum.

3. **Constant Space**:
   - The algorithm uses only constant extra space, adhering to the problem constraints.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the array.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(1)** extra space.

## 💡 **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        int r = numbers.size() - 1;
        int l = 0;
        while (l <= r) {
            int sum = numbers[l] + numbers[r];
            if (sum == target) return {l + 1, r + 1};
            if (sum < target) l++;
            else r--;
        }
        return {-1, -1};
    }
};
```

## 🔧 **Constraints**

- \( 2 \leq \text{numbers.length} \leq 3 \times 10^4 \)
- \( -1000 \leq \text{numbers}[i] \leq 1000 \)
- `numbers` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- \( -1000 \leq \text{target} \leq 1000 \)
- The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.

## 🌟 **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently finds the two numbers using a two-pointer technique.
- The solution handles large inputs effectively within the given constraints.
- The use of two pointers allows for a linear time complexity solution with constant space.
