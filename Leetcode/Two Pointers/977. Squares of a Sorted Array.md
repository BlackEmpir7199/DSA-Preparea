# ðŸ”¢ **Squares of a Sorted Array**

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to square each element in the array and return the squared values in non-decreasing order.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [-4, -1, 0, 3, 10]
Output: [0, 1, 9, 16, 100]
Explanation:
- After squaring, the array becomes [16, 1, 0, 9, 100].
- After sorting, it becomes [0, 1, 9, 16, 100].
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [-7, -3, 2, 3, 11]
Output: [4, 9, 9, 49, 121]
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Two-Pointer Technique**:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` at the beginning of the array and `right` at the end of the array.
   - Create a result array `ans` of the same size as `nums` to store the squared values.

2. **Two-Pointer Traversal**:
   - Compare the absolute values of the elements at the `left` and `right` pointers.
   - Square the larger value and place it at the end of the `ans` array.
   - Move the corresponding pointer (`left` or `right`) inward.
   - Continue this process until the `left` pointer is greater than the `right` pointer.

3. **Result**:
   - The `ans` array will contain the squared values in non-decreasing order.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the array. This is because each element is processed exactly once.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(n)** extra space to store the result array.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sortedSquares(vector<int>& nums) {
        int r = nums.size() - 1;
        int l = 0, i = r;
        vector<int> ans(nums.size());
        while (l <= r) {
            if (abs(nums[l]) < abs(nums[r])) {
                ans[i] = nums[r] * nums[r];
                r--;
            } else {
                ans[i] = nums[l] * nums[l];
                l++;
            }
            i--;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{nums.length} \leq 10^4 \)
- \( -10^4 \leq \text{nums}[i] \leq 10^4 \)
- `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently squares each element and sorts the result using the two-pointer technique.
- The solution handles the input effectively within the given constraints.
- The use of two pointers allows for an **O(n)** time complexity solution.
