# ðŸ’§ **Trapping Rain Water**

## Problem Description

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to calculate the amount of water trapped after raining.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: height = [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The elevation map is represented by the array [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: height = [4, 2, 0, 3, 2, 5]
Output: 9
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Two-Pointer Technique**:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` starting from the beginning and `right` starting from the end of the array.
   - Initialize variables `leftmax` and `rightmax` to keep track of the maximum heights encountered from the left and right, respectively.
   - Initialize a variable `total` to accumulate the total trapped water.

2. **Two-Pointer Traversal**:
   - While `left` is less than `right`, compare the heights at the `left` and `right` pointers.
   - If the height at `left` is less than the height at `right`:
     - Update `leftmax` with the maximum value between the current `leftmax` and the height at `left`.
     - Add the difference between `leftmax` and the height at `left` to `total` if it is positive.
     - Increment the `left` pointer.
   - If the height at `right` is less than or equal to the height at `left`:
     - Update `rightmax` with the maximum value between the current `rightmax` and the height at `right`.
     - Add the difference between `rightmax` and the height at `right` to `total` if it is positive.
     - Decrement the `right` pointer.

3. **Result**:
   - Return the total trapped water.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the array. This is because each element is processed exactly once.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(1)** extra space.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int trap(vector<int>& height) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.size() - 1;
        int leftmax = INT_MIN;
        int rightmax = INT_MIN;
        int total = 0;
        while (left < right) {
            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                leftmax = max(leftmax, height[left]);
                total += leftmax - height[left] > 0 ? leftmax - height[left] : 0;
                left++;
            } else {
                rightmax = max(rightmax, height[right]);
                total += rightmax - height[right] > 0 ? rightmax - height[right] : 0;
                right--;
            }
        }
        return total;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( n == \text{height.length} \)
- \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^4 \)
- \( 0 \leq \text{height}[i] \leq 10^5 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently calculates the trapped water using the two-pointer technique.
- The solution handles the input effectively within the given constraints.
- The use of two pointers allows for a linear time complexity solution with constant extra space.
