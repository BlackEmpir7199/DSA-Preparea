# ðŸš¤ **Boats to Save People**

## Problem Description

You are given an array `people` where `people[i]` is the weight of the `i-th` person, and an infinite number of boats where each boat can carry a maximum weight of `limit`. Each boat can carry at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of their weights is at most `limit`.

Return the minimum number of boats needed to carry every given person.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to determine the minimum number of boats required to carry all people.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: people = [1, 2], limit = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 boat (1, 2)
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: people = [3, 2, 2, 1], limit = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 boats (1, 2), (2), and (3)
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: people = [3, 5, 3, 4], limit = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: 4 boats (3), (3), (4), and (5)
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Two-Pointer Technique**:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Sort the array `people` to facilitate the use of the two-pointer technique.
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` starting from the beginning and `right` starting from the end of the array.
   - Initialize a counter `boats` to keep track of the number of boats used.

2. **Two-Pointer Traversal**:
   - While `left` is less than or equal to `right`, check if the sum of the weights at the `left` and `right` pointers is less than or equal to `limit`.
   - If the sum is within the limit, increment the `left` pointer.
   - Decrement the `right` pointer and increment the `boats` counter.
   - If the sum exceeds the limit, only decrement the `right` pointer and increment the `boats` counter.

3. **Result**:
   - Return the total count of boats used.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n log n)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the array. This is because sorting the array takes **O(n log n)** time, and the two-pointer traversal takes **O(n)** time.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(1)** extra space, excluding the space required for sorting.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numRescueBoats(vector<int>& people, int limit) {
        int boats = 0, r = people.size() - 1, l = 0;
        sort(people.begin(), people.end());
        while (r >= l) {
            int total_weight = people[l] + people[r] - (l == r ? people[l] : 0);
            if (total_weight <= limit) l++;
            boats++;
            r--;
        }
        return boats;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{people.length} \leq 5 \times 10^4 \)
- \( 1 \leq \text{people}[i] \leq \text{limit} \leq 3 \times 10^4 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently determines the minimum number of boats required using sorting and the two-pointer technique.
- The solution handles the input effectively within the given constraints.
- Sorting the array simplifies the process of pairing people to maximize the use of each boat.
