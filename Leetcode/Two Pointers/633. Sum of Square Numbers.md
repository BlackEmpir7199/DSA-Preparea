# ðŸ”¢ **Sum of Square Numbers**

## Problem Description

Given a non-negative integer `c`, determine whether there exist two integers `a` and `b` such that \( a^2 + b^2 = c \).

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to check if the given integer `c` can be expressed as the sum of the squares of two integers.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: c = 5
Output: true
Explanation: 1^2 + 2^2 = 5
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: c = 3
Output: false
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Two-Pointer Technique**:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a two-pointer approach where one pointer starts from 0 and the other from the square root of `c`.
   - Initialize two pointers, `a` starting from 0 and `b` starting from `sqrt(c)`.

2. **Two-Pointer Traversal**:
   - Calculate the sum of the squares of the numbers at the `a` and `b` pointers.
   - If the sum equals `c`, return `true`.
   - If the sum is less than `c`, increment the `a` pointer to increase the sum.
   - If the sum is greater than `c`, decrement the `b` pointer to decrease the sum.
   - Continue this process until the `a` pointer is greater than the `b` pointer.

3. **Result**:
   - If no such pair is found, return `false`.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(âˆšc)** time, where \( c \) is the given integer. This is because each pointer moves at most âˆšc steps.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(1)** extra space.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool judgeSquareSum(int c) {
        long long a = 0;
        long long b = sqrt(c);

        while (a <= b) {
            if (a * a + b * b == c) return true;
            if (a * a + b * b < c) a++;
            else b--;
        }

        return false;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 0 \leq c \leq 2^{31} - 1 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently checks if `c` can be expressed as the sum of two squares using the two-pointer technique.
- The solution handles the input effectively within the given constraints.
- The use of two pointers allows for an **O(âˆšc)** time complexity solution.
