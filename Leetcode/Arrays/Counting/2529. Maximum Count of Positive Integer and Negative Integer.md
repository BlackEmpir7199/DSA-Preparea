# ðŸ”¢ **Maximum Count of Positive Integer and Negative Integer**

## Problem Description

Given an array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, return the maximum between the number of positive integers and the number of negative integers.

In other words, if the number of positive integers in `nums` is `pos` and the number of negative integers is `neg`, then return the maximum of `pos` and `neg`. Note that `0` is neither positive nor negative.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to determine the maximum count between the number of positive integers and the number of negative integers in the array.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [-2, -1, -1, 1, 2, 3]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 positive integers and 3 negative integers. The maximum count among them is 3.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [-3, -2, -1, 0, 0, 1, 2]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 2 positive integers and 3 negative integers. The maximum count among them is 3.
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [5, 20, 66, 1314]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 positive integers and 0 negative integers. The maximum count among them is 4.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Binary Search Approach**

The algorithm efficiently determines the counts of positive and negative integers using binary search:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use the `lower_bound` function to find the first occurrence of a non-negative integer.
   - Use the `upper_bound` function to find the first occurrence of a positive integer.

2. **Calculate Counts**:
   - The number of negative integers is the distance from the beginning of the array to the first non-negative integer.
   - The number of positive integers is the distance from the first positive integer to the end of the array.

3. **Return Result**:
   - Return the maximum of the counts of positive and negative integers.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(log n)** time due to the binary search operations.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(1)** extra space.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumCount(vector<int>& nums) {
        auto non_neg = lower_bound(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);
        int neg = distance(nums.begin(), non_neg);
        auto first_pos = upper_bound(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);
        int pos = distance(first_pos, nums.end());
        return max(pos, neg);
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{nums.length} \leq 2000 \)
- \( -2000 \leq \text{nums}[i] \leq 2000 \)
- `nums` is sorted in a non-decreasing order.

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently determines the counts of positive and negative integers using binary search.
- The solution handles the input effectively within the given constraints.
- The use of binary search allows for a logarithmic time complexity solution.
