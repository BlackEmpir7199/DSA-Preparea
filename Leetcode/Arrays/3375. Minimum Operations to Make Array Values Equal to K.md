# ðŸ”¢ **Minimum Operations to Make Array Values Equal to K**

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. An integer `h` is called valid if all values in the array that are strictly greater than `h` are identical.

You are allowed to perform the following operation on `nums`:
- Select an integer `h` that is valid for the current values in `nums`.
- For each index `i` where `nums[i] > h`, set `nums[i]` to `h`.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make every element in `nums` equal to `k`. If it is impossible to make all elements equal to `k`, return `-1`.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to determine the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the array equal to `k`.

## âœ¨ **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [5, 2, 5, 4, 5], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation:
The operations can be performed in order using valid integers 4 and then 2.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [2, 1, 2], k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation:
It is impossible to make all the values equal to 2.
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [9, 7, 5, 3], k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation:
The operations can be performed using valid integers in the order 7, 5, 3, and 1.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Greedy Approach**

The algorithm uses a greedy approach to find the minimum number of operations:

- **Initialization**:
  - Check if all elements in `nums` are greater than or equal to `k`. If not, return `-1`.

- **Valid Integer Check**:
  - Traverse the `nums` array and check if there is a valid integer `h` such that all elements greater than `h` are identical.

- **Operations Count**:
  - Count the number of distinct valid integers `h` that need to be used to make all elements equal to `k`.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the `nums` array.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        unordered_set<int> set;
        for (int i : nums) {
            if (i < k) return -1;
            if (i > k) set.insert(i);
        }
        return set.size();
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{nums.length} \leq 100 \)
- \( 1 \leq \text{nums}[i] \leq 100 \)
- \( 1 \leq k \leq 100 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently finds the minimum number of operations using a greedy approach and a set to track distinct valid integers.
- The solution handles the constraints well and ensures that the operations are accurately counted.
- The use of a set allows for an efficient determination of the number of distinct valid integers.
