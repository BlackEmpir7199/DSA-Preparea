# ðŸ”„ **Search in Rotated Sorted Array II**

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `nums` that is sorted in **non-decreasing order**, but has been **rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k`. The resulting array will have the elements in the order `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]`.

Your task is to **search** for a given integer `target` in this rotated sorted array and return `true` if the target is present in the array, or `false` if it is not.

### **Important Note**:
The array `nums` may have **duplicate elements**, and this affects how the binary search is applied.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Given a rotated sorted array with potential duplicates, implement an efficient search for the target element in **O(log n)** or as close as possible.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: true
Explanation: The target 0 is found in the array.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: false
Explanation: The target 3 is not found in the array.
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,3,1,1,1], target = 3
Output: true
Explanation: The target 3 is found in the array.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Binary Search with Adjustments for Duplicates**:
Since the array is rotated and may contain duplicate values, we must adjust our binary search approach to handle duplicates:
1. **Comparison with Start and End**: If the middle element is equal to the start or end element, it is necessary to increment or decrement the `start` and `end` pointers to bypass duplicates.
2. **Divide Search Range**: If the array segment between `start` and `mid` is sorted, we can safely search within that range by comparing `target` with the `start` and `mid` values.
3. **Handle Rotated Part**: If the segment between `mid` and `end` is sorted, we can search that range instead.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The solution tries to maintain a **logarithmic** search with careful handling of duplicates. In the worst case, when duplicates are present, the time complexity can degrade to **O(n)** in rare cases.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = nums.length - 1;
        
        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = (start + end) / 2;
            
            if (nums[mid] == target) return true;
            
            // Handle the case where we have duplicates
            if (nums[mid] == nums[start] && nums[mid] == nums[end]) {
                start++;
                end--;
                continue;
            }
            
            // Check if the left side is sorted
            if (nums[start] <= nums[mid]) {
                if (nums[start] <= target && nums[mid] >= target) {
                    end = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    start = mid + 1;
                }
            }
            // Right side is sorted
            else {
                if (nums[mid] <= target && nums[end] >= target) {
                    start = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    end = mid - 1;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `nums` is guaranteed to be **rotated** at some pivot.
- `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4`

---

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The presence of **duplicates** affects the performance of the binary search.
- The **rotation** in the array means the array is partially sorted, and special care is needed when handling comparisons.
- Efficient search can still be achieved with a careful binary search algorithm, although in some cases, the time complexity can degrade to **O(n)** due to duplicates.
