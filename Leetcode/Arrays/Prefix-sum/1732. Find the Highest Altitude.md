# 🏞️ **Find the Highest Altitude**

## Problem Description

A biker is going on a road trip consisting of \( n + 1 \) points at different altitudes. The biker starts at point 0 with an altitude of 0. You are given an integer array `gain` of length \( n \), where `gain[i]` represents the net gain in altitude between points \( i \) and \( i + 1 \). Your task is to determine the highest altitude reached during the trip.

## 🎯 **Objective**

Write a function to calculate the highest altitude of a point given the net gains in altitude between consecutive points.

## ✨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: gain = [-5, 1, 5, 0, -7]
Output: 1
Explanation: The altitudes are [0, -5, -4, 1, 1, -6]. The highest altitude is 1.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: gain = [-4, -3, -2, -1, 4, 3, 2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The altitudes are [0, -4, -7, -9, -10, -6, -3, -1]. The highest altitude is 0.
```

## 🚀 **Approach**

### **Prefix Sum Calculation**

The algorithm calculates the altitude at each point using a prefix sum approach:

- **Initialization**:
  - Start with an initial altitude of 0.

- **Prefix Sum**:
  - Traverse the `gain` array and calculate the altitude at each point by adding the gain to the previous altitude.
  - Keep track of the maximum altitude encountered during the traversal.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the `gain` array.

## 💡 **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int largestAltitude(vector<int>& gain) {
        int maxi = 0;
        gain.insert(gain.begin(), 0);
        for (int i = 1; i < gain.size(); i++) {
            gain[i] = gain[i - 1] + gain[i];
            maxi = max(gain[i], maxi);
        }
        return maxi;
    }
};
```

---

## 🔧 **Constraints**

- \( n == \text{gain.length} \)
- \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \)
- \( -100 \leq \text{gain}[i] \leq 100 \)

## 🌟 **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently calculates the highest altitude using a prefix sum approach.
- The solution handles the constraints well and ensures that the highest altitude is accurately determined.
- The use of prefix sums allows for a straightforward calculation of altitudes at each point.
