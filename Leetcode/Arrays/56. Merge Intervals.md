# ðŸ”¢ **Merge Intervals**

## Problem Description

Given an array of intervals, where each interval is represented as `[starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals and return an array of non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to merge overlapping intervals and return the merged intervals.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: intervals = [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
Explanation: The intervals [1, 3] and [2, 6] overlap, so they are merged into [1, 6].
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: intervals = [[1, 4], [4, 5]]
Output: [[1, 5]]
Explanation: The intervals [1, 4] and [4, 5] overlap, so they are merged into [1, 5].
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Sorting and Merging**

The algorithm efficiently merges overlapping intervals:

- **Initialization**:
  - Sort the intervals based on their starting points.

- **Merge Intervals**:
  - Traverse the sorted intervals and merge them if they overlap.
  - If the current interval does not overlap with the last interval in the result, add it to the result.
  - If it overlaps, merge it by updating the end of the last interval in the result.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n log n)** time due to sorting, where \( n \) is the number of intervals.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(n)** extra space to store the merged intervals.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> merge(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        vector<vector<int>> ans;
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end());
        int n = intervals.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (ans.empty() || ans.back()[1] < intervals[i][0])
                ans.push_back(intervals[i]);
            else
                ans.back()[1] = max(ans.back()[1], intervals[i][1]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{intervals.length} \leq 10^4 \)
- \( \text{intervals}[i].length == 2 \)
- \( 0 \leq \text{starti} \leq \text{endi} \leq 10^4 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently merges overlapping intervals using sorting and a single pass through the intervals.
- The solution handles large inputs effectively within the given constraints.
- The use of sorting and merging allows for a straightforward and efficient solution.
