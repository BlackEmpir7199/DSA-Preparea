# ðŸ”Ž **Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array**

## Problem Description

You are given an array of integers `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and an integer `target`. Your task is to **find the starting and ending position** of the target value in the array.

If the target is **not found**, return `[-1, -1]`.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write an algorithm with **O(log n)** runtime complexity to find the first and last position of the target element.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3, 4]
Explanation: The target value 8 appears at positions 3 and 4.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1, -1]
Explanation: The target value 6 is not present in the array.
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [], target = 0
Output: [-1, -1]
Explanation: The array is empty, so no position is found.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Binary Search** 
Since the array is sorted, the **binary search** technique is optimal for solving this problem in **O(log n)** time.

- **First Position**:
  - Use binary search to find the **first occurrence** of the target.
  - Adjust the search boundaries to continue looking left, even when a match is found, ensuring the first position is found.

- **Last Position**:
  - Again, use binary search to find the **last occurrence**.
  - Adjust the boundaries to continue looking right when a match is found, ensuring the last position is captured.

### **Time Complexity**:
- Both operations are **O(log n)** due to the binary search, ensuring efficiency even for large arrays.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] searchRange(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[] result = new int[2];
        result[0] = findFirst(nums, target);  // Find first position
        result[1] = findLast(nums, target);   // Find last position
        return result;
    }

    private int findFirst(int[] nums, int target) {
        int start = 0, end = nums.length - 1;
        int first = -1;
        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                first = mid;  // Found the target, keep searching left
                end = mid - 1;
            } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
                start = mid + 1;
            } else {
                end = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return first;
    }

    private int findLast(int[] nums, int target) {
        int start = 0, end = nums.length - 1;
        int last = -1;
        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                last = mid;  // Found the target, keep searching right
                start = mid + 1;
            } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
                start = mid + 1;
            } else {
                end = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return last;
    }
}
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- `0 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `nums` is a **non-decreasing array**.
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The array is **sorted**, making binary search a perfect fit for finding positions in **O(log n)** time.
- If the target is not found, **[-1, -1]** is returned as a default response.
- The algorithm is designed to **handle large arrays efficiently**.
