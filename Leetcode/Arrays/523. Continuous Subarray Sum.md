# ðŸ”— **Continuous Subarray Sum**

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return `true` if `nums` has a good subarray or `false` otherwise. A good subarray is a subarray where its length is at least two, and the sum of the elements of the subarray is a multiple of `k`.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to determine if there exists a subarray within `nums` whose sum is a multiple of `k` and has a length of at least two.

## âœ¨ **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [23, 2, 4, 6, 7], k = 6
Output: true
Explanation: [2, 4] is a continuous subarray of size 2 whose elements sum up to 6.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [23, 2, 6, 4, 7], k = 6
Output: true
Explanation: [23, 2, 6, 4, 7] is a continuous subarray of size 5 whose elements sum up to 42. 42 is a multiple of 6 because 42 = 7 * 6 and 7 is an integer.
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [23, 2, 6, 4, 7], k = 13
Output: false
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Prefix Sum and Modulo Operation**

The algorithm uses a hash map to store the remainder of the prefix sum modulo `k`:

- **Initialization**:
  - Initialize a hash map to store the remainder of the prefix sum modulo `k` and its corresponding index.
  - Initialize the prefix sum to 0.
  - Add an entry for the remainder 0 with index -1 to handle the case where the sum itself is a multiple of `k`.

- **Traversal**:
  - Traverse the array while maintaining the prefix sum.
  - For each element, update the prefix sum and compute the remainder when divided by `k`.
  - Check if the remainder has been seen before:
    - If yes, and the distance between the current index and the stored index is at least 2, return `true`.
    - If no, store the remainder and the current index in the hash map.

- **Return**:
  - If no such subarray is found, return `false`.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is because each element is visited once.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(min(n, k))** space, where `n` is the number of elements in the array and `k` is the given integer. This is because the hash map stores at most `k` different remainders.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool checkSubarraySum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        unordered_map<int, int> map;
        int sum = 0;
        map[0] = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            sum += nums[i];
            if (map.find(sum % k) != map.end()) {
                if (i - map[sum % k] >= 2) return true;
            } else {
                map[sum % k] = i;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{nums.length} \leq 10^5 \)
- \( 0 \leq \text{nums}[i] \leq 10^9 \)
- \( 0 \leq \text{sum(nums[i])} \leq 2^{31} - 1 \)
- \( 1 \leq k \leq 2^{31} - 1 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently checks for a subarray with a sum that is a multiple of `k` using a hash map and prefix sum.
- The solution handles edge cases, such as when the sum itself is a multiple of `k`.
- The use of modulo operation ensures that the algorithm runs efficiently even for large values of `k`.
