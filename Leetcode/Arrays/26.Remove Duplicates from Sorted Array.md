# Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array ✨

This solution tackles the **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array** problem. It's efficient, clean, and achieves the required results with in-place modifications. Let's dive in! 🚀

## Problem Statement 📜

Given a sorted integer array `nums`, remove the duplicates **in-place** such that each unique element appears only once. The function should return the count of unique elements, `k`. 

👉 **Additional Rules**:  
1. The first `k` elements of `nums` must contain the unique elements in the original order.  
2. Beyond `k`, the values in `nums` don't matter.  

### **Examples** 👇

#### Example 1:  
**Input:**  
`nums = [1,1,2]`  
**Output:**  
`2, nums = [1,2,_]`  
Explanation: The unique numbers are 1 and 2. The rest can be ignored.

---

#### Example 2:  
**Input:**  
`nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]`  
**Output:**  
`5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]`  
Explanation: The unique numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

## How It Works 🛠️

The solution uses **two pointers** to efficiently iterate through the array:  
- `a` keeps track of the current position of unique elements.
- `b` scans the array for duplicates.  

When a new unique value is found, it updates `nums[a]` and advances both pointers. At the end, `a + 1` gives the count of unique elements.

## Code Implementation 💻

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int a = 0; // Pointer for the current position of unique elements
        int b = 0; // Pointer for scanning duplicates
        int n = nums.length;
        int unq = n > 0 ? 1 : 0; // Count of unique elements
        
        while (b < n && a < n) {
            if (nums[b] == nums[a]) {
                b++; // Skip duplicates
            } else {
                unq++; // Found a unique element
                a++; // Move unique pointer
                nums[a] = nums[b]; // Update the unique array
                b++; // Move scanning pointer
            }
        }
        return unq;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis 🚦

### Time Complexity:  
- **O(n)**: Each element in `nums` is visited only once.

### Space Complexity:  
- **O(1)**: The solution modifies the array in-place without extra space.

---

## Custom Judge 🧑‍⚖️

The judge tests the function as follows:

```java
int[] nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4];
int[] expectedNums = [0,1,2,3,4];

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Returns 5

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```

## Cool Features 🚀
✅ In-place modification: No extra memory used!  
✅ Efficient time complexity: Linear traversal for a sorted array.  
✅ Easy to integrate with custom judges for testing.
