# üîç **Longest Nice Subarray**

## Problem Description

You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers. A subarray of `nums` is considered "nice" if the bitwise AND of every pair of elements in different positions within the subarray is equal to 0.

Your task is to find the length of the longest nice subarray.

## üéØ **Objective**

Write a function to determine the length of the longest nice subarray in the given array.

## ‚ú® **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1, 3, 8, 48, 10]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest nice subarray is [3, 8, 48]. This subarray satisfies the conditions:
- 3 AND 8 = 0
- 3 AND 48 = 0
- 8 AND 48 = 0
No longer nice subarray can be found, so the output is 3.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [3, 1, 5, 11, 13]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest nice subarray has a length of 1. Any subarray of length 1 is considered nice.
```

## üöÄ **Approach**

### **Sliding Window with Bitwise Operations**

The algorithm uses a sliding window technique combined with bitwise operations:

- **Initialization**:
  - Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to maintain the current window of the subarray.
  - Use a variable `windowsum` to keep track of the bitwise OR of the current window.

- **Expanding the Window**:
  - Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer and updating `windowsum` with the bitwise OR of the current element.
  - If the bitwise AND of the current element and `windowsum` is not zero, shrink the window from the left until the condition is satisfied.

- **Updating Maximum Length**:
  - Update the maximum length of the nice subarray found so far.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the array.

## üí° **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestNiceSubarray(vector<int>& arr) {
        int left = 0, maxi = 1, windowsum = 0;
        for (int right = 0; right < arr.size(); right++) {
            while (arr[right] & windowsum) {
                windowsum ^= arr[left++];
            }
            windowsum |= arr[right];
            maxi = max(maxi, right - left + 1);
        }
        return maxi;
    }
};
```

## üîß **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{nums.length} \leq 10^5 \)
- \( 1 \leq \text{nums}[i] \leq 10^9 \)

## üåü **Key Points**

- The sliding window technique efficiently finds the longest nice subarray.
- Bitwise operations are used to check the "nice" condition and update the window.
- The solution handles large arrays within the given constraints effectively.
