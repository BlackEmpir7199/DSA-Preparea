# ðŸ“… **Count Days Without Meetings**

## Problem Description

You are given a positive integer `days` representing the total number of days an employee is available for work, starting from day 1. You are also given a 2D array `meetings` where each element `meetings[i] = [start_i, end_i]` represents the starting and ending days of meeting `i` (inclusive).

Your task is to determine the count of days when the employee is available for work but no meetings are scheduled.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to count the number of days without any scheduled meetings.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: days = 10, meetings = [[5, 7], [1, 3], [9, 10]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is no meeting scheduled on the 4th and 8th days.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: days = 5, meetings = [[2, 4], [1, 3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is no meeting scheduled on the 5th day.
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: days = 6, meetings = [[1, 6]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Meetings are scheduled for all working days.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Sorting and Merging Intervals**

The algorithm efficiently counts the days without meetings:

- **Initialization**:
  - Sort the `meetings` array to facilitate merging overlapping intervals.

- **Merging Intervals**:
  - Traverse the sorted `meetings` array and merge overlapping intervals.
  - Track the last day of the previous meeting to determine gaps between meetings.

- **Counting Free Days**:
  - For each gap between meetings, count the number of days without meetings.
  - After processing all meetings, count any remaining days after the last meeting.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n log n)** time due to sorting, where \( n \) is the number of meetings.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countDays(int days, vector<vector<int>>& meetings) {
        sort(meetings.begin(), meetings.end());
        int ans = 0, last = 0;
        for (auto it : meetings) {
            int st = it[0], ed = it[1];
            if (last < st) {
                ans += st - last - 1;
            }
            last = max(last, ed);
        }
        ans += days - last;
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{days} \leq 10^9 \)
- \( 1 \leq \text{meetings.length} \leq 10^5 \)
- \( \text{meetings}[i].length == 2 \)
- \( 1 \leq \text{meetings}[i][0] \leq \text{meetings}[i][1] \leq \text{days} \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently counts days without meetings using sorting and merging intervals.
- The solution handles large inputs effectively within the given constraints.
- The use of sorting and merging ensures that overlapping meetings are handled correctly.
