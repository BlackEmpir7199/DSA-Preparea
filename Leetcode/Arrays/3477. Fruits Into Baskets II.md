# 🍎 **Fruits Into Baskets II**

## Problem Description

You are given two arrays of integers, `fruits` and `baskets`, each of length `n`. The array `fruits[i]` represents the quantity of the `i-th` type of fruit, and `baskets[j]` represents the capacity of the `j-th` basket.

The goal is to place the fruits into the baskets according to the following rules:
1. Each fruit type must be placed in the leftmost available basket with a capacity greater than or equal to the quantity of that fruit type.
2. Each basket can hold only one type of fruit.
3. If a fruit type cannot be placed in any basket, it remains unplaced.

Return the number of fruit types that remain unplaced after all possible allocations are made.

## 🎯 **Objective**

Write a function to determine the number of fruit types that remain unplaced after attempting to place all fruits into the baskets.

## ✨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: fruits = [4, 2, 5], baskets = [3, 5, 4]
Output: 1
Explanation:
- fruits[0] = 4 is placed in baskets[1] = 5.
- fruits[1] = 2 is placed in baskets[0] = 3.
- fruits[2] = 5 cannot be placed in baskets[2] = 4.
Since one fruit type remains unplaced, we return 1.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: fruits = [3, 6, 1], baskets = [6, 4, 7]
Output: 0
Explanation:
- fruits[0] = 3 is placed in baskets[0] = 6.
- fruits[1] = 6 cannot be placed in baskets[1] = 4 (insufficient capacity) but can be placed in the next available basket, baskets[2] = 7.
- fruits[2] = 1 is placed in baskets[1] = 4.
Since all fruits are successfully placed, we return 0.
```

## 🚀 **Approach**

### **Greedy Approach**

The algorithm efficiently places the fruits into the baskets using a greedy approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Iterate through each fruit type and attempt to place it in the leftmost available basket with sufficient capacity.

2. **Placement Logic**:
   - For each fruit type, check each basket from left to right.
   - If a basket has sufficient capacity (greater than or equal to the fruit quantity) and is not already used, place the fruit in the basket and mark the basket as used.
   - If no suitable basket is found, the fruit remains unplaced.

3. **Count Unplaced Fruits**:
   - After attempting to place all fruits, count the number of baskets that remain unused.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n^2)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the arrays.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(1)** extra space.

## 💡 **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numOfUnplacedFruits(vector<int>& fruits, vector<int>& baskets) {
        for (int i = 0; i < fruits.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < baskets.size(); j++) {
                if (baskets[j] >= fruits[i] && baskets[j] != 0) {
                    baskets[j] = 0;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int b : baskets)
            if (b != 0) cnt++;
        return cnt;
    }
};
```

## 🔧 **Constraints**

- \( n == \text{fruits.length} == \text{baskets.length} \)
- \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \)
- \( 1 \leq \text{fruits}[i], \text{baskets}[i] \leq 1000 \)

## 🌟 **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently places the fruits into the baskets using a greedy approach.
- The solution handles the input effectively within the given constraints.
- The use of nested loops allows for a straightforward implementation of the placement logic.
