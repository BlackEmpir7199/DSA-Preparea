# 🎨 **Sort Colors**

## Problem Description

Given an array `nums` with `n` objects, each object is colored **red**, **white**, or **blue**. The goal is to sort the array **in-place** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors appearing in the order **red**, **white**, and **blue**.

We use integers to represent the colors:
- `0` represents **red**.
- `1` represents **white**.
- `2` represents **blue**.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

---

## 🎯 **Objective**
- Sort the array in **one pass** using only **constant extra space**.

---

## ✨ **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
Explanation: The array is sorted in-place with red (0), white (1), and blue (2) grouped together in order.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
```

## 🚀 **Approach**

### **Dutch National Flag Algorithm**:
This problem can be solved efficiently using the **Dutch National Flag** algorithm:
1. Maintain three pointers: `low`, `mid`, and `high`.
2. Use the following rules during the traversal:
   - If the current element is `0`, swap it with the element at `low`, then increment both `low` and `mid`.
   - If the current element is `1`, move `mid` forward.
   - If the current element is `2`, swap it with the element at `high` and decrement `high`.
3. Stop when `mid > high`.

### **Steps**:
- Traverse the array once and sort the elements by swapping them into their correct positions.
- This ensures **O(n)** time complexity with **O(1)** space.

## 💡 **Code Implementation**

```java
class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int low = 0, mid = 0, high = n - 1;
        
        while (mid <= high) {
            if (nums[mid] == 0) { 
                swap(nums, low, mid);
                low++;
                mid++;
            } else if (nums[mid] == 1) {
                mid++;
            } else { 
                swap(nums, mid, high);
                high--;
            }
        }
    }
    
    static void swap(int[] arr, int i, int j) {
        int temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[j];
        arr[j] = temp;
    }
}
```

## 🔧 **Constraints**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 300`
- `nums[i]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`.

---

## 🌟 **Key Points**
1. **One-Pass Algorithm**: The solution sorts the array in a single traversal.
2. **Constant Space**: No extra space is used, apart from a few variables.
3. **Efficient**: This approach has a time complexity of **O(n)** and a space complexity of **O(1)**.

---

## 🛠️ **How It Works**
1. **Pointer Explanation**:
   - `low`: Tracks the boundary for elements equal to `0`.
   - `mid`: Traverses the array.
   - `high`: Tracks the boundary for elements equal to `2`.
2. The algorithm keeps swapping elements into their correct positions and adjusts the boundaries dynamically.

## ✨ **Examples Walkthrough**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]

Initial State:
low = 0, mid = 0, high = 5
nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]

Step 1:
nums[mid] = 2 -> Swap(nums[mid], nums[high])
nums = [0,0,2,1,1,2]
low = 0, mid = 0, high = 4

Step 2:
nums[mid] = 0 -> Swap(nums[mid], nums[low])
nums = [0,0,2,1,1,2]
low = 1, mid = 1, high = 4

Step 3:
nums[mid] = 0 -> Swap(nums[mid], nums[low])
nums = [0,0,1,1,2,2]
low = 2, mid = 2, high = 4

Step 4:
nums[mid] = 1 -> Increment mid
nums = [0,0,1,1,2,2]
low = 2, mid = 3, high = 4

Step 5:
nums[mid] = 1 -> Increment mid
nums = [0,0,1,1,2,2]
low = 2, mid = 4, high = 4

Step 6:
nums[mid] = 2 -> Swap(nums[mid], nums[high])
nums = [0,0,1,1,2,2]
low = 2, mid = 4, high = 3

Final Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```
