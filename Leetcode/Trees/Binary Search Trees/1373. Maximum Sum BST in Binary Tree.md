# 1373. Maximum Sum BST in Binary Tree

## Problem Description
Given a binary tree, return the maximum sum of all keys of any subtree which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST).

### BST Definition:
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

### Examples
- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `root = [1,4,3,2,4,2,5,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,6]`
  - Output: `20`
  - Explanation: The subtree rooted at node 3 is a BST with sum 20.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `root = [4,3,null,1,2]`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: The subtree rooted at node 2 is a BST with sum 2.

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `root = [-4,-2,-5]`
  - Output: `0`
  - Explanation: No valid BST subtree with positive sum.

### Constraints
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 4 * 10^4]`.
- `-4 * 10^4 <= Node.val <= 4 * 10^4`

## Approach
The solution uses a **post-order traversal** to check if each subtree is a BST and calculate its sum if it is. 

### Key Steps:
1. **Post-order Traversal**: Traverse the tree in post-order (left, right, root) to ensure we have information about both subtrees before processing the current node.
2. **BST Validation**: For each node, check if its left and right subtrees are BSTs and if the current node's value satisfies the BST property.
3. **Sum Calculation**: If the subtree rooted at the current node is a BST, calculate its sum and update the maximum sum found so far.
4. **Return Information**: For each subtree, return whether it is a BST, its sum, and the minimum and maximum values in the subtree.

### Solution Code
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
    struct Info {
        bool isBST;
        int sum;
        int minVal;
        int maxVal;
    };

    int maxSum = 0;

    Info bstFind(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return {true, 0, INT_MAX, INT_MIN};

        Info left = bstFind(root->left);
        Info right = bstFind(root->right);

        if (left.isBST && right.isBST && left.maxVal < root->val && right.minVal > root->val) {
            int sum = root->val + left.sum + right.sum;
            maxSum = max(maxSum, sum);
            return {
                true,
                sum,
                min(left.minVal, root->val),
                max(right.maxVal, root->val)
            };
        }

        return {false, 0, 0, 0};
    }

public:
    int maxSumBST(TreeNode* root) {
        bstFind(root);
        return maxSum;
    }
};
```

## Explanation
1. **Post-order Traversal**: The function `bstFind` recursively processes the left and right subtrees before the current node.
2. **BST Validation**: For each node, it checks if both left and right subtrees are BSTs and if the current node's value is greater than the maximum value in the left subtree and less than the minimum value in the right subtree.
3. **Sum Calculation**: If the subtree is a valid BST, the sum of the subtree is calculated and the global `maxSum` is updated if this sum is larger.
4. **Return Information**: The function returns an `Info` struct indicating whether the subtree is a BST, its sum, and the minimum and maximum values in the subtree.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` - Each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(h)` - The recursion stack can go up to the height of the tree, where `h` is the height of the tree. In the worst case (skewed tree), this is `O(n)`.

This approach efficiently checks each subtree for the BST property while calculating the maximum sum, leveraging post-order traversal to ensure all necessary information is available when processing each node.
