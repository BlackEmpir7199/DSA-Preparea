# All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree

## Problem Description
Given the root of a binary tree, a target node, and an integer `k`, return all nodes at distance `k` from the target node.

### Examples
- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]`, `target = 5`, `k = 2`
  - Output: `[7,4,1]`
  - Explanation: Nodes 7 and 4 are children of node 2 (distance 2 from 5), and node 1 is the other child of the root (distance 2 from 5).

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `root = [1]`, `target = 1`, `k = 3`
  - Output: `[]`

### Constraints
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 500]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 500`
- All `Node.val` are unique.
- `target` is a node in the tree.
- `0 <= k <= 1000`

## Approach
The solution uses a **BFS (Breadth-First Search)** approach after first mapping each node to its parent. This allows us to traverse the tree not just downwards (to children) but also upwards (to parents).

### Key Steps:
1. **Parent Mapping**: Create a hash map to store each node's parent.
2. **BFS Traversal**: Starting from the target node, perform a BFS to explore nodes at increasing distances.
3. **Distance Tracking**: Stop when we reach distance `k` and collect all nodes at that level.

### Solution Code
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    void markParents(TreeNode* root, unordered_map<TreeNode*, TreeNode*>& parent_track) {
        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            TreeNode* node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            
            if (node->left) {
                parent_track[node->left] = node;
                q.push(node->left);
            }
            if (node->right) {
                parent_track[node->right] = node;
                q.push(node->right);
            }
        }
    }

    vector<int> distanceK(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* target, int k) {
        unordered_map<TreeNode*, TreeNode*> parent_track;
        markParents(root, parent_track);

        unordered_map<TreeNode*, bool> visited;
        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        visited[target] = true;
        q.push(target);
        int cur_lvl = 0;

        while (!q.empty()) {
            if (cur_lvl == k) break;
            cur_lvl++;
            int size = q.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                TreeNode* node = q.front();
                q.pop();
                
                if (node->left && !visited[node->left]) {
                    q.push(node->left);
                    visited[node->left] = true;
                }
                if (node->right && !visited[node->right]) {
                    q.push(node->right);
                    visited[node->right] = true;
                }
                if (parent_track[node] && !visited[parent_track[node]]) {
                    q.push(parent_track[node]);
                    visited[parent_track[node]] = true;
                }
            }
        }

        vector<int> res;
        while (!q.empty()) {
            TreeNode* node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            res.push_back(node->val);
        }

        return res;
    }
};
```

## Explanation
1. **Parent Mapping**: The `markParents` function performs a BFS to traverse the tree and records each node's parent in a hash map (`parent_track`).
2. **BFS Initialization**: Start BFS from the `target` node, marking it as visited.
3. **Level-wise Traversal**: For each level (distance from `target`), explore all neighboring nodes (left child, right child, and parent). Mark nodes as visited to avoid revisiting.
4. **Result Collection**: When the current level equals `k`, collect all nodes remaining in the queue as they are at distance `k` from the target.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` - Each node is visited at most twice (once during parent mapping and once during BFS).
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` - The parent map and visited set each store `O(n)` entries, and the queue can hold up to `O(n)` nodes in the worst case.

This approach efficiently locates all nodes at a given distance from the target by leveraging BFS and parent pointers, ensuring comprehensive exploration of the tree in all directions.
