# ðŸŒ³ **Diameter of Binary Tree**

## Problem Description

Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to calculate the diameter of the binary tree.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: The diameter is the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
```

### Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The diameter is the path [2,1].
```

### Example 3:

```plaintext
Input: root = [1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There's only one node, so diameter is 0.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Recursive Depth-First Search**

The algorithm efficiently calculates the diameter using recursion:

1. **Initialization**:

   - Use a helper function `diameter` that returns the height of the tree while updating the diameter.
   - Use a variable `dia` to keep track of the maximum diameter found.

2. **Recursive Calculation**:
   - For each node, calculate the heights of left and right subtrees.
   - Update the diameter if the sum of left and right heights is greater than current diameter.
   - Return the height of the current node (1 + max of left and right heights).

### **Time Complexity**:

- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as it visits each node exactly once.

### **Space Complexity**:

- The algorithm uses **O(h)** space for the call stack, where h is the height of the tree (O(n) in worst case for unbalanced trees).

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int diameter(TreeNode* root, int& dia) {
        if(!root) return 0;

        int lh = diameter(root->left, dia);
        int rh = diameter(root->right, dia);

        dia = max(lh + rh, dia);

        return 1 + max(lh, rh);
    }

    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
        int dia = 0;
        diameter(root, dia);
        return dia;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The diameter is calculated as the maximum of (left height + right height) for each node.
- The solution efficiently computes both height and diameter simultaneously during traversal.
- The algorithm handles all edge cases including single node and empty trees.
