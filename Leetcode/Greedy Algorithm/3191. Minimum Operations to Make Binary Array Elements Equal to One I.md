# ðŸ”„ **Minimum Operations to Make Binary Array Elements Equal to One**

## Problem Description

You are given a binary array `nums`. You can perform the following operation any number of times:

- Choose any 3 consecutive elements from the array and flip all of them. Flipping an element means changing its value from 0 to 1, and from 1 to 0.

Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in `nums` equal to 1. If it is impossible, return `-1`.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to calculate the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements in the array equal to 1.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
Output: 3
Explanation:
- Flip elements at indices 0, 1, and 2: nums = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
- Flip elements at indices 1, 2, and 3: nums = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
- Flip elements at indices 3, 4, and 5: nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [0, 1, 1, 1]
Output: -1
Explanation: It is impossible to make all elements equal to 1.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Flipping Strategy**

The algorithm uses a greedy approach to flip the elements:

- **Initialization**:
  - Traverse the array and flip any 3 consecutive elements where the first element is 0.

- **Flipping**:
  - For each element, if it is 0, flip it and the next two elements.
  - Increment the operation count each time a flip is performed.

- **Check Feasibility**:
  - After processing, check the last two elements. If either is 0, return `-1` as it is impossible to make all elements 1.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the array.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int cnt = 0, n = nums.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 2; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == 0) {
                nums[i] = 1 - nums[i];
                nums[i + 1] = 1 - nums[i + 1];
                nums[i + 2] = 1 - nums[i + 2];
                cnt++;
            }
        }
        return ((nums[n - 1] == 0) || (nums[n - 2] == 0)) ? -1 : cnt;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 3 \leq \text{nums.length} \leq 10^5 \)
- \( 0 \leq \text{nums}[i] \leq 1 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The greedy approach efficiently flips elements to achieve the goal.
- The solution checks the feasibility of making all elements 1 after performing the operations.
- The algorithm handles large arrays within the given constraints effectively.
