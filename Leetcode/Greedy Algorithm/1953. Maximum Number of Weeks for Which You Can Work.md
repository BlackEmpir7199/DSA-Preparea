# ðŸ“… **Maximum Number of Weeks for Which You Can Work**

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `milestones` where each `milestones[i]` denotes the number of milestones the `i-th` project has. You can work on the projects following these rules:

- Every week, you will finish exactly one milestone of one project.
- You must work every week.
- You cannot work on two milestones from the same project for two consecutive weeks.

Return the maximum number of weeks you would be able to work on the projects without violating the rules mentioned above.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to determine the maximum number of weeks you can work on the projects without violating the given rules.

## âœ¨ **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: milestones = [1, 2, 3]
Output: 6
Explanation: One possible scenario is:
- During the 1st week, you will work on a milestone of project 0.
- During the 2nd week, you will work on a milestone of project 2.
- During the 3rd week, you will work on a milestone of project 1.
- During the 4th week, you will work on a milestone of project 2.
- During the 5th week, you will work on a milestone of project 1.
- During the 6th week, you will work on a milestone of project 2.
The total number of weeks is 6.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: milestones = [5, 2, 1]
Output: 7
Explanation: One possible scenario is:
- During the 1st week, you will work on a milestone of project 0.
- During the 2nd week, you will work on a milestone of project 1.
- During the 3rd week, you will work on a milestone of project 0.
- During the 4th week, you will work on a milestone of project 1.
- During the 5th week, you will work on a milestone of project 0.
- During the 6th week, you will work on a milestone of project 2.
- During the 7th week, you will work on a milestone of project 0.
The total number of weeks is 7.
Note that you cannot work on the last milestone of project 0 on the 8th week because it would violate the rules.
Thus, one milestone in project 0 will remain unfinished.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Greedy Approach**

The algorithm uses a greedy approach to maximize the number of weeks you can work:

- **Initialization**:
  - Calculate the total sum of milestones.
  - Find the maximum number of milestones in any single project.

- **Calculation**:
  - Subtract the maximum milestones from the total sum to get the remaining milestones.
  - If the remaining milestones are greater than or equal to the maximum milestones, you can work on all milestones.
  - Otherwise, you can work on the remaining milestones plus one additional week.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the `milestones` array.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long numberOfWeeks(vector<int>& milestones) {
        long long sum = 0;
        int max = *max_element(milestones.begin(), milestones.end());
        for (int i : milestones)
            sum += i;
        sum -= max;
        if (sum >= max)
            return sum + max;
        return sum * 2 + 1;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{milestones.length} \leq 10^5 \)
- \( 1 \leq \text{milestones}[i] \leq 10^9 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently determines the maximum number of weeks using a greedy approach.
- The solution handles the constraints well and ensures that the rules are not violated.
- The use of a greedy approach allows for an efficient determination of the maximum number of weeks.
