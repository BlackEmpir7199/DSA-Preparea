# Jump Game - Solution Explanation

## Intuition
The problem requires determining if it's possible to reach the last index of an array where each element represents the maximum jump length from that position. The key insight is that we can use a greedy approach to track the farthest reachable index at each step.

## Approach
The solution uses a single variable:
- `maxIdx`: Tracks the farthest index that can be reached from the current position

### Algorithm Steps:
1. Iterate through each element in the array
2. If the current index `i` exceeds the farthest reachable index (`maxIdx`), return false immediately
3. Otherwise, update `maxIdx` to be the maximum between its current value and `i + nums[i]` (the farthest we can jump from the current position)
4. If we successfully iterate through the entire array, return true

## Solution Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canJump(vector<int>& nums) {
        int maxIdx = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (i > maxIdx) return false;
            maxIdx = max(maxIdx, i + nums[i]);
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - We make a single pass through the array
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - We use only constant extra space

## Example Walkthroughs

### Example 1: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
1. Initial state: maxIdx=0
2. i=0: maxIdx=max(0,0+2)=2
3. i=1: maxIdx=max(2,1+3)=4
4. i=2: maxIdx=max(4,2+1)=4
5. i=3: maxIdx=max(4,3+1)=4
6. i=4: maxIdx=max(4,4+4)=8
7. Loop completes, return true

**Explanation**: Can jump from 0→1→4 (or 0→2→3→4) to reach the end

### Example 2: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
1. Initial state: maxIdx=0
2. i=0: maxIdx=max(0,0+3)=3
3. i=1: maxIdx=max(3,1+2)=3
4. i=2: maxIdx=max(3,2+1)=3
5. i=3: maxIdx=max(3,3+0)=3
6. i=4: i (4) > maxIdx (3) → return false

**Explanation**: Gets stuck at index 3 (with jump length 0) and can't reach the end

## Key Insights
- The greedy approach efficiently tracks reachability by maintaining the farthest accessible index
- We fail immediately if we encounter an index that's beyond our current maximum reach
- The algorithm is optimal with O(n) time and O(1) space complexity
- This approach works because if we can't get past a certain point, we'll never reach the end

## Comparison with Jump Game II
While both problems deal with jumping through arrays:
- Jump Game (this problem) just checks if reaching the end is possible
- Jump Game II (previous problem) finds the minimum number of jumps needed
- Both use similar greedy approaches but with different tracking variables
