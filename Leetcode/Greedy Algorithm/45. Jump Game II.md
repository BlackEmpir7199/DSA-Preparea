# Jump Game II - Solution Notes

## Problem Statement
Given a 0-indexed array `nums` where each element represents the maximum jump length from that position, return the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the last index.

## Approach
The solution uses a greedy algorithm with the following key variables:
- `maxIdx`: Tracks the farthest index that can be reached
- `currEnd`: Marks the end of the current jump's range
- `cnt`: Counts the number of jumps made

### Algorithm Steps:
1. Iterate through the array (except the last element)
2. Update `maxIdx` to be the maximum between its current value and `i + nums[i]`
3. When we reach `currEnd` (the boundary of our current jump):
   - Increment the jump count
   - Extend `currEnd` to `maxIdx` (the farthest we can reach with this jump)

## Solution Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int jump(vector<int>& nums) {
        int maxIdx=0, currEnd=0, cnt=0;
        for(int i=0; i<nums.size()-1; i++) {
            maxIdx = max(maxIdx, i+nums[i]);
            if(i == currEnd) {
                cnt++;
                currEnd = maxIdx;
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- O(n): We make a single pass through the array

## Space Complexity
- O(1): We use only constant extra space

## Key Insights
- The greedy approach works because we always want to jump as far as possible in each step
- We don't need to track every possible path, just the farthest reach at each step
- The condition `i == currEnd` triggers when we've exhausted all options in the current jump range

## Example Walkthrough
For `nums = [2,3,1,1,4]`:
1. Initial state: maxIdx=0, currEnd=0, cnt=0
2. i=0: maxIdx=2 (0+2), i==currEnd → cnt=1, currEnd=2
3. i=1: maxIdx=max(2,1+3)=4
4. i=2: maxIdx remains 4, i==currEnd → cnt=2, currEnd=4
5. Loop ends (i < nums.size()-1)
6. Return cnt=2

This matches the example where we jump from index 0→1→4.
