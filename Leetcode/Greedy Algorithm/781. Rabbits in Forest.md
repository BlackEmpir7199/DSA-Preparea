# 🐇 **Rabbits in Forest**

## Problem Description

In a forest, there is an unknown number of rabbits. We asked `n` rabbits the question: "How many rabbits have the same color as you?" and collected their answers in an integer array `answers`, where `answers[i]` is the answer of the `i-th` rabbit.

The goal is to determine the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest based on the given answers.

## 🎯 **Objective**

Write a function to calculate the minimum number of rabbits in the forest given the array of answers.

## ✨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: answers = [1, 1, 2]
Output: 5
Explanation:
The two rabbits that answered "1" could both be the same color, say red.
The rabbit that answered "2" can't be red or the answers would be inconsistent.
Say the rabbit that answered "2" was blue.
Then there should be 2 other blue rabbits in the forest that didn't answer into the array.
The smallest possible number of rabbits in the forest is therefore 5: 3 that answered plus 2 that didn't.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: answers = [10, 10, 10]
Output: 11
```

## 🚀 **Approach**

### **Hashmap and Greedy Technique**

The algorithm efficiently calculates the minimum number of rabbits using a hashmap and a greedy approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a hashmap `mpp` to store the frequency of each answer.
   - Use a variable `total` to store the total number of rabbits.

2. **Iterate Through Answers**:
   - For each answer in the array:
     - If the answer is `0`, it means the rabbit has a unique color, so increment the total by `1`.
     - If the answer is already in the hashmap, it means we have already counted a group of rabbits with the same color, so decrement the count in the hashmap.
     - Otherwise, add the number of rabbits with the same color (`answer + 1`) to the total and increment the count in the hashmap.

3. **Calculate Total Rabbits**:
   - The total number of rabbits is the sum of all unique groups of rabbits calculated.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the array.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(n)** extra space for the hashmap.

## 💡 **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numRabbits(vector<int>& answers) {
        unordered_map<int,int> mpp;
        int total= 0;
        for(int i:answers){
            if(i==0) total+=1;
            else if(mpp[i]>0) mpp.erase(mpp[i]);
            else{
                total+=i+1;
                mpp[i]++;
            }
        }
        return total;
    }
};
```

## 🔧 **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{answers.length} \leq 1000 \)
- \( 0 \leq \text{answers}[i] < 1000 \)

## 🌟 **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently calculates the minimum number of rabbits using a hashmap and a greedy approach.
- The solution handles the input effectively within the given constraints.
- The use of a hashmap allows for a linear time complexity solution.
