# Maximum Wealth of the Richest Customer 🌟

This problem involves calculating the total wealth of each customer from their bank account data and finding the maximum wealth among them. Below is an explanation and implementation of the solution.

---

## Problem Statement 📜

You are given an `m x n` integer grid `accounts`, where:  
- `accounts[i][j]` is the amount of money the `i`th customer has in the `j`th bank.

**Objective:**  
- Calculate the wealth of each customer as the sum of their bank accounts.
- Return the maximum wealth.

---

## Approach 🚀

1. **Iterate through each customer**:  
   For each customer, calculate the sum of their bank balances.

2. **Track the maximum wealth**:  
   Keep updating the maximum wealth as we calculate the wealth for each customer.

3. **Return the maximum wealth**:  
   At the end of the loop, the result is the maximum wealth among all customers.

### Code Implementation 💻

Here’s the Java solution:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumWealth(int[][] accounts) {
        int ans = 0; // Variable to store the maximum wealth
        for (int i = 0; i < accounts.length; i++) {
            int sum = 0; // Variable to store the wealth of the current customer
            for (int k : accounts[i]) {
                sum += k; // Add each bank balance to the sum
            }
            if (ans < sum) {
                ans = sum; // Update the maximum wealth if the current wealth is greater
            }
        }
        return ans; // Return the maximum wealth
    }
}
```

## Examples 📋

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]`  
**Output:**  
`6`  

**Explanation:**  
1. Wealth of Customer 1 = \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\)  
2. Wealth of Customer 2 = \(3 + 2 + 1 = 6\)  
**Maximum wealth = 6**

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]`  
**Output:**  
`10`

**Explanation:**  
1. Wealth of Customer 1 = \(1 + 5 = 6\)  
2. Wealth of Customer 2 = \(7 + 3 = 10\)  
3. Wealth of Customer 3 = \(3 + 5 = 8\)  
**Maximum wealth = 10**

---

### Example 3:
**Input:**  
`accounts = [[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]`  
**Output:**  
`17`  

**Explanation:**  
1. Wealth of Customer 1 = \(2 + 8 + 7 = 17\)  
2. Wealth of Customer 2 = \(7 + 1 + 3 = 11\)  
3. Wealth of Customer 3 = \(1 + 9 + 5 = 15\)  
**Maximum wealth = 17**

## Complexity Analysis 🚦

### Time Complexity:
- **O(m × n)**:  
   We traverse each of the `m` rows and calculate the sum for `n` columns.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**:  
   No additional space is used; the calculation is done in-place.

---

## Key Features ✨
- **Efficient**: Linear traversal ensures minimal computational overhead.
- **Readable**: The code is concise and easy to follow.
- **Scalable**: Handles maximum constraints (up to \(50 \times 50\)) seamlessly.
