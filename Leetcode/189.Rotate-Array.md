# LeetCode - 189. Rotate Array 🔄  

**The Art of Rotation: Mastering Array Manipulations**  

---

### 🧩 **The Problem**  

You're given an integer array `nums` and a non-negative integer `k`. Your mission is to rotate the array to the right by `k` steps.  

Rotation is like a carousel—you shift elements, and those that fall off the end wrap back to the start!  

---

### 🌟 **Examples**  

#### **Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]`, `k = 3`  
Output: `[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]`  

#### **Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [-1,-100,3,99]`, `k = 2`  
Output: `[3,99,-1,-100]`  

---

### 🚦 **Constraints**  
1. `1 <= nums.length <= 105`  
2. `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`  
3. `0 <= k <= 105`  

---

### 🔍 **The Detective's Toolbox**  

We need to rotate the array **in-place** (O(1) space complexity) with **O(n)** time complexity. The rotation should feel seamless, as if shifting is happening in one fluid motion.  

---

### 🛠 **The Solution: The Triple Reverse Trick**  

This solution employs a clever mathematical approach called **Triple Reverse** to rotate the array:  

1. **Break the Problem into Three Pieces:**  
   - Divide the array into two parts:  
     - Part 1: From the beginning to `n-k-1`.  
     - Part 2: From `n-k` to the end.  
2. **Reverse Each Part Individually:**  
   - Reverse the first part.  
   - Reverse the second part.  
3. **Combine the Parts:**  
   - Reverse the entire array to achieve the final rotated result!  

---

### 💡 **How It Works: Step-by-Step**  

#### **Step 1:** Reverse Part 1  
Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]`  
Reverse `[1,2,3,4]` → `[4,3,2,1]`  

#### **Step 2:** Reverse Part 2  
Reverse `[5,6,7]` → `[7,6,5]`  

#### **Step 3:** Reverse Entire Array  
Reverse `[4,3,2,1,7,6,5]` → `[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]`

### 📜 **The Code: Rotating Like a Pro**  

```java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        k = k % n; // Handle cases where k > n
        rotator(nums, 0, n - k - 1); // Reverse the first part
        rotator(nums, n - k, n - 1); // Reverse the second part
        rotator(nums, 0, n - 1);     // Reverse the entire array
    }
    
    static void rotator(int[] arr, int left, int right) {
        while (left <= right) {
            int temp = arr[left];
            arr[left] = arr[right];
            arr[right] = temp;
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }
}
```

### 📈 **Complexity Analysis**  

- **Time Complexity:**  
  - O(n) → Each element is processed at most twice (once per reverse operation).  

- **Space Complexity:**  
  - O(1) → The algorithm operates in-place without requiring extra memory.  

---

### 🧐 **Why This Works**  

The triple reverse method uses simple array manipulation techniques to shuffle elements into their correct positions efficiently. By breaking the array into parts and reversing them strategically, we maintain both clarity and optimal performance.  

---

### 🔗 **Alternate Approaches**  

1. **Cyclic Replacements:** Rotate elements one by one (O(n) time, O(1) space).  
2. **Extra Array:** Use an auxiliary array to store the rotated result and copy it back (O(n) time, O(n) space).  

---

### 🌌 **Conclusion**  

The **Triple Reverse Trick** is a powerful technique for solving array rotation problems in a concise and efficient way. It’s a great example of how mathematical insight and clever manipulation can make complex problems feel simple.  

Happy solving! 🚀
