# ðŸ”Ž **Count Total Number of Colored Cells**

## Problem Description

You are given an infinitely large two-dimensional grid of uncolored unit cells. You must perform a routine for \( n \) minutes:

- At the first minute, color any arbitrary unit cell blue.
- Every minute thereafter, color blue every uncolored cell that touches a blue cell.

Your task is to determine the total number of colored cells at the end of \( n \) minutes.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write an algorithm to calculate the total number of colored cells after \( n \) minutes.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: After 1 minute, there is only 1 blue cell, so we return 1.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: n = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: After 2 minutes, there are 4 colored cells on the boundary and 1 in the center, so we return 5.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Pattern Recognition**

The problem involves recognizing a pattern in the growth of colored cells over time. The pattern can be described mathematically:

- At minute 1, there is 1 colored cell.
- Each subsequent minute, the number of colored cells increases in a predictable manner, forming a diamond shape.

### **Formula Derivation**

The formula for the total number of colored cells after \( n \) minutes is:

\[ \text{Total colored cells} = 2n^2 - 2n + 1 \]

This formula is derived from observing the geometric progression of the colored cells over time.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The formula provides a direct calculation, making the solution **O(1)** in time complexity.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```java
class Solution {
    public int totalColoredCells(int n) {
        return 2 * n * n - 2 * n + 1;
    }
}
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The pattern of cell coloring follows a predictable geometric progression.
- The formula \( 2n^2 - 2n + 1 \) efficiently calculates the total number of colored cells.
- The algorithm is designed to handle large values of \( n \) efficiently.
