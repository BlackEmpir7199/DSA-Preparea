# ðŸ”¢ **Count Symmetric Integers**

## Problem Description

You are given two positive integers `low` and `high`. An integer `x` consisting of `2 * n` digits is symmetric if the sum of the first `n` digits of `x` is equal to the sum of the last `n` digits of `x`. Numbers with an odd number of digits are never symmetric.

Return the number of symmetric integers in the range `[low, high]`.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to count the number of symmetric integers within the given range `[low, high]`.

## âœ¨ **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: low = 1, high = 100
Output: 9
Explanation: There are 9 symmetric integers between 1 and 100: 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, and 99.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: low = 1200, high = 1230
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 symmetric integers between 1200 and 1230: 1203, 1212, 1221, and 1230.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Brute Force with Symmetric Check**

The algorithm uses a brute force approach to check each number in the range and determine if it is symmetric:

- **Initialization**:
  - Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of symmetric integers.

- **Symmetric Check**:
  - Convert the number to a string and check if the length is even.
  - Calculate the sum of the first half and the second half of the digits.
  - If the sums are equal, the number is symmetric.

- **Counting Symmetric Integers**:
  - Iterate through each number in the range `[low, high]`.
  - Use the symmetric check function to determine if the number is symmetric.
  - Increment the counter if the number is symmetric.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n * m)** time, where \( n \) is the number of integers in the range `[low, high]` and \( m \) is the average number of digits in the integers.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
    bool isSymmetric(int n) {
        string s = to_string(n);
        int len = s.length();
        if (len % 2 != 0) return false;
        int lsum = 0, rsum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < len / 2; ++i) {
            lsum += s[i] - '0';
            rsum += s[len - i - 1] - '0';
        }
        return lsum == rsum;
    }

public:
    int countSymmetricIntegers(int low, int high) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = low; i <= high; ++i) {
            if (isSymmetric(i)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{low} \leq \text{high} \leq 10^4 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently counts the number of symmetric integers using a brute force approach with a symmetric check function.
- The solution handles the constraints well and ensures that each number is accurately checked for symmetry.
- The use of a helper function allows for a clear and modular implementation.
