# ðŸ”¢ **Check if Number is a Sum of Powers of Three**

## Problem Description

Given an integer `n`, determine if it is possible to represent `n` as the sum of distinct powers of three. A number `y` is a power of three if there exists an integer `x` such that \( y = 3^x \).

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to check if `n` can be expressed as the sum of distinct powers of three.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: n = 12
Output: true
Explanation: 12 can be expressed as \( 3^1 + 3^2 \).
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: n = 91
Output: true
Explanation: 91 can be expressed as \( 3^0 + 3^2 + 3^4 \).
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: n = 21
Output: false
Explanation: 21 cannot be expressed as the sum of distinct powers of three.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Division by Three**

The algorithm checks if `n` can be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of three:

- **Initialization**:
  - Continuously divide `n` by 3 and check the remainder.

- **Check Remainder**:
  - If at any point the remainder when `n` is divided by 3 is greater than 1, it means `n` cannot be expressed as the sum of distinct powers of three.
  - This is because any valid sum of distinct powers of three, when divided by 3, should yield a remainder of 0 or 1.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(logâ‚ƒ(n))** time, which is efficient for large values of `n`.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkPowersOfThree(int n) {
        while (n) {
            if (n % 3 > 1) return false;
            n /= 3;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^7 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently checks if a number can be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of three using simple division.
- The solution handles the constraints well and ensures that the result is accurate.
- The use of modulo operation allows for a straightforward check of the number's representation in base 3.
