# 🔢 **Power of Three**

## Problem Description

Given an integer `n`, determine if it is a power of three. An integer `n` is a power of three if there exists an integer `x` such that \( n = 3^x \).

## 🎯 **Objective**

Write a function to check if a given integer is a power of three.

## ✨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: n = 27
Output: true
Explanation: 27 is a power of three because \( 27 = 3^3 \).
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: n = 0
Output: false
Explanation: There is no integer `x` such that \( 3^x = 0 \).
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: n = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no integer `x` such that \( 3^x = -1 \).
```

## 🚀 **Approach**

### **Iterative Division**

The algorithm checks if `n` is a power of three by repeatedly dividing by 3:

- **Initialization**:
  - If `n` is less than or equal to 0, return `false` since negative numbers and zero cannot be powers of three.

- **Division**:
  - Continuously divide `n` by 3 as long as it is divisible by 3.
  - If after division `n` equals 1, it is a power of three.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(log₃(n))** time due to the division operations.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(1)** extra space.

## 💡 **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        if (n <= 0) return false;
        while (n % 3 == 0) n /= 3;
        return n == 1;
    }
};
```

## 🔧 **Constraints**

- \( -2^{31} \leq n \leq 2^{31} - 1 \)

## 🌟 **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently checks if a number is a power of three using simple division.
- The solution handles edge cases such as zero and negative numbers.
- The use of division allows for a straightforward check of the number's representation in base 3.

## 🔍 **Follow-up**

To solve this problem without loops or recursion, you can use mathematical properties. Specifically, you can check if `n` is a power of three by determining if \( n \) is the only integer that, when divided by the maximum power of three less than \( 2^{31} - 1 \), results in an integer. This can be done using the expression:

\[ n > 0 \text{ and } 1162261467 \% n == 0 \]

Where \( 1162261467 \) is \( 3^{19} \), the largest power of three less than \( 2^{31} - 1 \). This approach leverages the fact that \( 3^{19} \) will only be divisible by powers of three.

Here's how you can implement this:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        return n > 0 && 1162261467 % n == 0;
    }
};
```

This solution avoids loops and recursion by utilizing the properties of integer division.
