# ðŸª™ **Arranging Coins**

## Problem Description

You have `n` coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of `k` rows where the `i-th` row has exactly `i` coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.

Given the integer `n`, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to determine the number of complete rows of the staircase that can be built with `n` coins.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: n = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Mathematical Approach**

The problem can be solved using a mathematical approach based on the sum of the first `k` natural numbers:

1. **Sum of First `k` Natural Numbers**:
   - The sum of the first `k` natural numbers is given by the formula: \( \text{Sum} = \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \).

2. **Rearrange the Formula**:
   - To find the maximum `k` such that the sum is less than or equal to `n`, we rearrange the formula to solve for `k`:
     \[
     k^2 + k - 2n = 0
     \]
   - This is a quadratic equation in the form \( ak^2 + bk + c = 0 \).

3. **Solve the Quadratic Equation**:
   - Use the quadratic formula \( k = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) to solve for `k`.
   - Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = -2n \).

4. **Calculate the Result**:
   - The solution for `k` is given by:
     \[
     k = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 + 8n}}{2}
     \]
   - Since `k` must be an integer, we take the floor of the result.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(1)** time.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(1)** extra space.

        return (int)((-1LL + sqrtl(1 + 8LL * n)) / 2);
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq n \leq 2^{31} - 1 \)
