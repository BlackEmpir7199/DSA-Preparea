# ðŸ”¢ **The kth Factor of n**

## Problem Description

You are given two positive integers `n` and `k`. A factor of an integer `n` is defined as an integer `i` where `n % i == 0`. Your task is to return the `k`-th factor of `n` when the factors are listed in ascending order. If `n` has fewer than `k` factors, return `-1`.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to find the `k`-th factor of `n`.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: n = 12, k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The factors of 12 are [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]. The 3rd factor is 3.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: n = 7, k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: The factors of 7 are [1, 7]. The 2nd factor is 7.
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: n = 4, k = 4
Output: -1
Explanation: The factors of 4 are [1, 2, 4]. There are only 3 factors, so return -1.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Efficient Factorization**

The algorithm efficiently finds the `k`-th factor:

- **Initialization**:
  - Iterate from 1 to the square root of `n` to find factors.

- **Factorization**:
  - For each potential factor `i`, check if `i` divides `n`.
  - Decrement `k` each time a factor is found. If `k` becomes zero, return the current factor.

- **Reverse Factorization**:
  - After checking up to the square root, iterate backward to find the remaining factors by dividing `n` by each factor found in the first loop.
  - Skip the square root factor if `n` is a perfect square to avoid duplication.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(âˆšn)** time, making it efficient for large values of `n`.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int kthFactor(int n, int k) {
        int i;
        for (i = 1; i <= sqrt(n); i++) {
            while (n % i == 0 && --k == 0)
                return i;
        }
        for (i = i - 1; i >= 1; i--) {
            if (i * i == n) continue;
            while (n % i == 0 && --k == 0)
                return n / i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 1000 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently finds the `k`-th factor using factorization up to the square root of `n`.
- The solution handles the constraints well and ensures that the result is accurate.
- The use of factorization and reverse iteration allows for an efficient solution with reduced complexity.
