# ðŸ”¢ **Minimum Operations to Make a Uni-Value Grid**

## Problem Description

You are given a 2D integer grid of size \( m \times n \) and an integer \( x \). In one operation, you can add \( x \) to or subtract \( x \) from any element in the grid. Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the grid equal (i.e., a uni-value grid). If it is not possible, return `-1`.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to calculate the minimum number of operations to make the grid uni-value.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: grid = [[2, 4], [6, 8]], x = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Make every element equal to 4 by:
- Adding \( x \) to 2 once.
- Subtracting \( x \) from 6 once.
- Subtracting \( x \) from 8 twice.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: grid = [[1, 5], [2, 3]], x = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: Make every element equal to 3.
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: grid = [[1, 2], [3, 4]], x = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: It is impossible to make every element equal.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Modulo Check and Median Calculation**

The algorithm checks if it's possible to make the grid uni-value and calculates the minimum operations:

- **Initialization**:
  - Flatten the grid into a 1D list and check if all elements have the same remainder when divided by \( x \). If not, return `-1`.

- **Median Calculation**:
  - Use the median of the flattened list as the target value for all elements. The median minimizes the total number of operations required.

- **Operation Count**:
  - Calculate the total number of operations needed to make all elements equal to the median value by adding or subtracting \( x \).

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(m \times n \times \log(m \times n))** time due to sorting the flattened list to find the median.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int x) {
        vector<int> flat;
        int mod = grid[0][0] % x;
        for (auto& row : grid) {
            for (int val : row) {
                if (val % x != mod) return -1;
                flat.push_back(val);
            }
        }
        int mid = flat.size() / 2;
        nth_element(flat.begin(), flat.begin() + mid, flat.end());
        mid = flat[mid];
        int count = 0;
        for (int y : flat) {
            count += abs(y - mid) / x;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( m == \text{grid.length} \)
- \( n == \text{grid}[i].length \)
- \( 1 \leq m, n \leq 10^5 \)
- \( 1 \leq m \times n \leq 10^5 \)
- \( 1 \leq x, \text{grid}[i][j] \leq 10^4 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently checks the feasibility of making the grid uni-value using modulo operations.
- The use of the median ensures that the number of operations is minimized.
- The solution handles large inputs effectively within the given constraints.
