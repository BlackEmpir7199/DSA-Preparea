# ðŸ’¦ **Container With Most Water**

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `height` of length \( n \). There are \( n \) vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the \( i \)-th line are \( (i, 0) \) and \( (i, \text{height}[i]) \).

Your task is to find two lines that, together with the x-axis, form a container that can hold the most water.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write an algorithm to determine the maximum amount of water a container can store.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The vertical lines are represented by the array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. The maximum area of water the container can hold is 49.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The vertical lines are represented by the array [1,1]. The maximum area of water the container can hold is 1.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Two-Pointer Technique**

The algorithm uses the two-pointer technique to efficiently find the maximum area:

- **Initialization**:
  - Start with two pointers, `left` at the beginning (`l = 0`) and `right` at the end (`r = height.size() - 1`) of the array.

- **Calculation**:
  - Calculate the width of the container as the distance between the two pointers (`r - l`).
  - The height of the container is determined by the shorter line between the two pointers (`min(height[l], height[r])`).
  - Calculate the area and update the maximum area if the current area is larger.

- **Move Pointers**:
  - Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward, as moving the taller line inward cannot possibly form a larger container.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, making it efficient for large arrays.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int l = 0, r = height.size() - 1, maxarea = 0;
        while (r > l) {
            int w = r - l;
            int h = min(height[r], height[l]);
            int area = w * h;
            maxarea = max(maxarea, area);
            (height[r] < height[l]) ? r-- : l++;
        }
        return maxarea;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( n == \text{height.length} \)
- \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)
- \( 0 \leq \text{height}[i] \leq 10^4 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The two-pointer technique is efficient for finding the maximum area with a linear time complexity.
- The algorithm ensures that all possible containers are considered by moving the pointers inward based on the height of the lines.
- The solution is optimal for the given constraints and handles edge cases effectively.
