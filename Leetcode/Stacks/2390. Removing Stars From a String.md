# ðŸ”¤ **Removing Stars From a String**

## Problem Description

You are given a string `s` that contains stars `*`. In one operation, you can choose a star in `s`, remove the closest non-star character to its left, and remove the star itself.

Return the string after all stars have been removed.

**Note**:
- The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible.
- It can be shown that the resulting string will always be unique.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to return the string after all stars have been removed.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: s = "leet**cod*e"
Output: "lecoe"
Explanation: Performing the removals from left to right:
- The closest character to the 1st star is 't' in "leet**cod*e". s becomes "lee*cod*e".
- The closest character to the 2nd star is 'e' in "lee*cod*e". s becomes "lecod*e".
- The closest character to the 3rd star is 'd' in "lecod*e". s becomes "lecoe".
There are no more stars, so we return "lecoe".
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: s = "erase*****"
Output: ""
Explanation: The entire string is removed, so we return an empty string.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Stack-Based Approach**

The algorithm efficiently removes stars using a stack:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a stack `st` to keep track of characters.

2. **Iterate Through Characters**:
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is a star `*`, pop the top element from the stack (removing the closest non-star character to its left).
     - Otherwise, push the character onto the stack.

3. **Construct Result**:
   - After processing all characters, construct the result string from the stack.
   - Reverse the result string to get the correct order.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the string.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(n)** extra space for the stack.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string removeStars(string s) {
        stack<char> st;
        for(char c:s){
            if(c=='*'){
                st.pop();
            }
            else st.push(c);
        }
        string result = "";
        while (!st.empty()) {
            result += st.top();
            st.pop();
        }
        reverse(result.begin(),result.end());
        return result;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{s.length} \leq 10^5 \)
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters and stars `*`.
- The operation above can be performed on `s`.

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently removes stars using a stack.
- The solution handles large inputs effectively within the given constraints.
- The use of a stack allows for a linear time complexity solution.
