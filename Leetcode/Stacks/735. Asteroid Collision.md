# ðŸŒ  **Asteroid Collision**

## Problem Description

We are given an array `asteroids` of integers representing asteroids in a row. The indices of the asteroids in the array represent their relative positions in space.

For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.

The goal is to find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to determine the state of the asteroids after all collisions.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: asteroids = [5, 10, -5]
Output: [5, 10]
Explanation: The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10. The 5 and 10 never collide.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: asteroids = [8, -8]
Output: []
Explanation: The 8 and -8 collide exploding each other.
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: asteroids = [10, 2, -5]
Output: [10]
Explanation: The 2 and -5 collide resulting in -5. The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Stack-Based Approach**

The algorithm efficiently determines the state of the asteroids using a stack:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a stack `st` to keep track of asteroids.

2. **Iterate Through Asteroids**:
   - For each asteroid in the array:
     - If the asteroid is moving to the right (positive value), push it onto the stack.
     - If the asteroid is moving to the left (negative value):
       - While the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is a positive asteroid smaller than the absolute value of the current asteroid, pop the stack.
       - If the stack is empty or the top of the stack is a negative asteroid, push the current asteroid onto the stack.
       - If the top of the stack is equal to the absolute value of the current asteroid, pop the stack.

3. **Construct Result**:
   - After processing all asteroids, construct the result vector from the stack.
   - Reverse the result vector to get the correct order.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the array.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(n)** extra space for the stack.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> asteroidCollision(vector<int>& asteroids) {
        stack<int> st;
        for(int i:asteroids){
            if(i>0) st.push(i);
            else{
                while(!st.empty() && st.top()>0 && st.top()<-i) st.pop();
                if(st.empty() || st.top()<0) st.push(i);
                if(!st.empty() && st.top()==-i) st.pop();
            }
        }
        vector<int> vc;
        while(!st.empty()){
            vc.push_back(st.top());
            st.pop();
        }
        reverse(vc.begin(),vc.end());
        return vc;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 2 \leq \text{asteroids.length} \leq 10^4 \)
- \( -1000 \leq \text{asteroids}[i] \leq 1000 \)
- `asteroids[i] != 0`

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently determines the state of the asteroids using a stack.
- The solution handles large inputs effectively within the given constraints.
- The use of a stack allows for a linear time complexity solution.
