# ðŸ”¤ **Sorting the Sentence**

## Problem Description

A sentence is a list of words separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters. A sentence can be shuffled by appending the 1-indexed word position to each word and then rearranging the words.

Given a shuffled sentence `s` containing no more than 9 words, reconstruct and return the original sentence.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to reconstruct the original sentence from a shuffled sentence where each word is appended with its original position.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: s = "is2 sentence4 This1 a3"
Output: "This is a sentence"
Explanation: Sort the words in `s` to their original positions "This1 is2 a3 sentence4", then remove the numbers.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: s = "Myself2 Me1 I4 and3"
Output: "Me Myself and I"
Explanation: Sort the words in `s` to their original positions "Me1 Myself2 and3 I4", then remove the numbers.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Mapping and Sorting**

The algorithm reconstructs the sentence by mapping each word to its original position:

- **Initialization**:
  - Use a map to store each word with its corresponding position.

- **Parsing**:
  - Traverse the string and extract words and their positions.
  - Store each word in the map with its position as the key.

- **Reconstruction**:
  - Iterate over the map in sorted order of positions and concatenate the words to form the original sentence.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the string.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string sortSentence(string s) {
        map<int, string> map;
        string ans = "";
        for (char c : s) {
            if (isdigit(c)) {
                map[c - '0'] = ans;
                ans = "";
            } else if (c != ' ') {
                ans += c;
            }
        }
        ans = "";
        for (auto it : map) {
            ans += " " + it.second;
        }
        return ans.substr(1);
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 2 \leq \text{s.length} \leq 200 \)
- `s` consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters, spaces, and digits from 1 to 9.
- The number of words in `s` is between 1 and 9.
- The words in `s` are separated by a single space.
- `s` contains no leading or trailing spaces.

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently reconstructs the original sentence using a map to store word positions.
- The solution handles the constraints well and ensures that the result is accurate.
- The use of a map allows for easy sorting and reconstruction of the sentence.
