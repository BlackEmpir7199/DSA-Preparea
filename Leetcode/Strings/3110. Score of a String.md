# 3110. Score of a String 🧮

Welcome to the **Score of a String** repository! This project provides a simple and efficient solution to calculate the score of a string based on the absolute differences between the ASCII values of adjacent characters. This is a great problem to practice string manipulation and basic arithmetic operations in C++.

## Problem Statement 📜

You are given a string `s`. The **score** of a string is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the ASCII values of adjacent characters.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** `s = "hello"`
- **Output:** `13`
- **Explanation:**
  - ASCII values: `'h' = 104`, `'e' = 101`, `'l' = 108`, `'o' = 111`
  - Score = `|104 - 101| + |101 - 108| + |108 - 108| + |108 - 111| = 3 + 7 + 0 + 3 = 13`

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** `s = "zaz"`
- **Output:** `50`
- **Explanation:**
  - ASCII values: `'z' = 122`, `'a' = 97`
  - Score = `|122 - 97| + |97 - 122| = 25 + 25 = 50`

### Constraints
- `2 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Solution Code 💻

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int scoreOfString(string s) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size() - 1; i++) {
            sum += abs(s[i] - s[i + 1]);
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
```

## Explanation 🧠

1. **Initialization:**
   - We start by initializing a variable `sum` to `0`. This will hold the cumulative score of the string.

2. **Loop Through the String:**
   - We loop through the string from the first character to the second last character (`s.size() - 1`).
   - For each pair of adjacent characters, we calculate the absolute difference between their ASCII values using `abs(s[i] - s[i + 1])`.

3. **Summing Up:**
   - We add this absolute difference to `sum`.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - After the loop finishes, we return the `sum` which is the score of the string.

## Time and Space Complexity ⏳

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string. We traverse the string once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
