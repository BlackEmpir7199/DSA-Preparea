# ðŸ”„ **Merge Strings Alternately**

## Problem Description

You are given two strings, `word1` and `word2`. Your task is to merge these strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. If one string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to merge the two strings alternately and return the merged string.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string is formed as follows:
- word1:  a   b   c
- word2:    p   q   r
- merged: a p b q c r
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Since `word2` is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
- word1:  a   b
- word2:    p   q   r   s
- merged: a p b q   r   s
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Since `word1` is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
- word1:  a   b   c   d
- word2:    p   q
- merged: a p b q c   d
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Alternating Merge**

The algorithm merges the strings by alternating characters:

- **Initialization**:
  - Start with two indices, `i` for `word1` and `j` for `word2`, both initialized to 0.

- **Merging**:
  - Use a loop to alternate between adding characters from `word1` and `word2` to the result string.
  - Increment the respective index after adding a character.

- **Appending Remainders**:
  - After the loop, if there are remaining characters in either string, append them to the result.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n + m)** time, where \( n \) and \( m \) are the lengths of `word1` and `word2`, respectively.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
        string ans = "";
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < word1.size() && j < word2.size()) {
            ans += word1[i++];
            ans += word2[j++];
        }
        while (i < word1.size()) {
            ans += word1[i++];
        }
        while (j < word2.size()) {
            ans += word2[j++];
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq \text{word1.length}, \text{word2.length} \leq 100 \)
- `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently merges the strings by alternating characters.
- The solution handles strings of different lengths by appending any remaining characters after the main loop.
- The implementation is straightforward and adheres to the problem constraints.
