# Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target 🔍

In this problem, we are given a sorted array of characters and a target character. We need to find the smallest letter in the array that is lexicographically greater than the target. If no such letter exists, return the first letter in the array.

---

## Problem Overview 📜

### Input:
- A sorted array of characters `letters`.
- A target character `target`.

### Output:
- The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than `target`. If no such character exists, return the first character in the array.

## Approach 🚀

We can efficiently solve this problem using **binary search** since the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Steps:
1. **Binary Search**:  
   - We start with two pointers: `start` (at index 0) and `end` (at the last index).
   - Calculate the middle index `mid` of the array.
   - If `letters[mid]` is less than or equal to the target, move the `start` pointer to `mid + 1`.
   - If `letters[mid]` is greater than the target, move the `end` pointer to `mid - 1`.
2. **Find the Result**:  
   - After the binary search ends, `start` will be pointing at the index of the smallest letter that is greater than `target`. If such a letter does not exist (i.e., the `start` pointer exceeds the array length), we wrap around and return the first letter.

### Why Binary Search?
- Binary search works efficiently here because the list is sorted, allowing us to skip half of the elements at each step.

### Code Implementation 💻

Here’s the Java code that implements the solution using binary search:

```java
class Solution {
    public char nextGreatestLetter(char[] letters, char target) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = letters.length - 1;
        
        // Binary search for the next greatest letter
        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            
            if (letters[mid] <= target) {
                start = mid + 1; // Move the start pointer to the right
            } else {
                end = mid - 1; // Move the end pointer to the left
            }
        }
        
        // If no letter greater than target is found, start will be out of bounds,
        // so we return the first letter in the array using modulo
        return letters[start % letters.length];
    }
}
```

## Examples 📋

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"`  
**Output:**  
`"c"`

**Explanation:**  
The smallest character lexicographically greater than 'a' is 'c'.  
---

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"`  
**Output:**  
`"f"`

**Explanation:**  
The smallest character lexicographically greater than 'c' is 'f'.  
---

### Example 3:
**Input:**  
`letters = ["x","x","y","y"], target = "z"`  
**Output:**  
`"x"`

**Explanation:**  
There is no character greater than 'z', so we return the first character, which is 'x'.

## Complexity Analysis 🚦

### Time Complexity:
- **O(log n)**:  
  Since we are using binary search, the time complexity is logarithmic with respect to the length of the array.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**:  
  We are only using a constant amount of extra space for the pointers (`start`, `end`, and `mid`).

## Key Features ✨

- **Efficient**: The binary search approach ensures that the solution works even for large inputs (up to \(10^4\) characters).
- **Elegant Solution**: The solution is optimal in terms of time and space complexity.

Run the code, and you're all set! If no letter greater than the target exists, you’ll get the first character in the list, making it a well-rounded solution. Happy coding! 😊
