# ðŸ”„ **Reverse Words in a String**

## Problem Description

Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the words. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters, and words in `s` are separated by at least one space. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words, with no leading or trailing spaces.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to reverse the order of words in a string, ensuring that the resulting string has no extra spaces.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: The reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: Multiple spaces between words should be reduced to a single space in the reversed string.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach 1: Reverse and Rebuild**

### **Algorithm**

1. **Reverse the Entire String**:
   - Reverse the entire string to bring the last word to the front.

2. **Extract Words and Reverse Each**:
   - Traverse the reversed string and extract words by identifying spaces.
   - Reverse each extracted word to restore its original form.
   - Append each word to the result string with a single space separator.

3. **Construct the Result**:
   - Ensure no leading or trailing spaces in the final result.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the string.

### **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string reverseWords(string s) {
        string result = "";
        int n = s.size();
        reverse(s.begin(), s.end());
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            string word = "";
            while (i < n && s[i] != ' ') {
                word += s[i++];
            }
            reverse(word.begin(), word.end());
            if (!word.empty()) {
                result += " " + word;
            }
        }
        return result.substr(1);
    }
};
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach 2: Single Pass Reversal**

### **Algorithm**

1. **Traverse from the End**:
   - Start from the end of the string and build words by moving backwards.

2. **Build Words**:
   - Collect characters into a temporary string until a space is encountered.
   - Append the temporary string to the result string with a single space separator.

3. **Construct the Result**:
   - Ensure no leading or trailing spaces in the final result.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the string.

### **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string reverseWords(string s) {
        string temp, result;
        for (int i = s.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s[i] != ' ') {
                temp = s[i] + temp;
            } else if (!temp.empty()) {
                if (!result.empty()) {
                    result += " ";
                }
                result += temp;
                temp.clear();
            }
        }
        if (!temp.empty()) {
            if (!result.empty()) {
                result += " ";
            }
            result += temp;
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq s.length \leq 10^4 \)
- `s` contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces `' '`.
- There is at least one word in `s`.

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- Both approaches efficiently reverse the order of words in a string.
- The solutions handle leading, trailing, and multiple spaces effectively.
- The algorithms ensure that the resulting string has no extra spaces and is formatted correctly.
