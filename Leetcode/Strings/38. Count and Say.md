# ðŸ“ˆ **Count and Say Sequence**

## Problem Description

The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

- `countAndSay(1) = "1"`
- `countAndSay(n)` is the run-length encoding of `countAndSay(n - 1)`.

Run-length encoding (RLE) is a string compression method that replaces consecutive identical characters with the concatenation of the character and the count of those characters. For example, compressing the string `"3322251"` results in `"23321511"`.

Your task is to return the \( n \)-th element of the count-and-say sequence.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Implement a function to generate the \( n \)-th term of the count-and-say sequence.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: n = 4
Output: "1211"
Explanation:
- countAndSay(1) = "1"
- countAndSay(2) = RLE of "1" = "11"
- countAndSay(3) = RLE of "11" = "21"
- countAndSay(4) = RLE of "21" = "1211"
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: n = 1
Output: "1"
Explanation: This is the base case.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Recursive Construction**

The algorithm constructs the sequence iteratively:

- **Initialization**:
  - Start with the base case `countAndSay(1) = "1"`.

- **Iteration**:
  - For each subsequent term, generate the run-length encoding of the previous term.
  - Traverse the current string, count consecutive identical digits, and append the count and digit to the next string.

- **Update**:
  - Update the current string to the newly generated string for the next iteration.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n \times k)** time, where \( k \) is the length of the string at each step, which grows with \( n \).

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string countAndSay(int n) {
        string curr = "1";
        for (int k = 1; k < n; k++) {
            string next = "";
            int i = 0;
            while (i < curr.size()) {
                int cnt = 1;
                while (curr.size() - 1 > i && curr[i] == curr[i + 1]) {
                    cnt++;
                    i++;
                }
                next += to_string(cnt) + string(1, curr[i]);
                i++;
            }
            curr = next;
        }
        return curr;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq n \leq 30 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently constructs the count-and-say sequence using run-length encoding.
- The solution handles the constraints well and is designed to work within the given limits.
- The iterative approach ensures that each term is built based on the previous term, maintaining the sequence's integrity.
