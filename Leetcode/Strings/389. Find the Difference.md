# ðŸ”— **Find the Difference**

## Problem Description

You are given two strings `s` and `t`. String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then adding one more letter at a random position. Return the letter that was added to `t`.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to find and return the additional letter in string `t`.

## âœ¨ **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
Explanation: 'y' is the letter that was added.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Character Summation**

The algorithm uses the summation of ASCII values to find the additional letter:

- **Initialization**:
  - Initialize a variable `sum` to 0.

- **Summation**:
  - Iterate through each character in string `t` and add its ASCII value to `sum`.
  - Iterate through each character in string `s` and subtract its ASCII value from `sum`.

- **Result**:
  - The remaining value in `sum` will be the ASCII value of the additional letter.
  - Convert this ASCII value back to a character and return it.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where `n` is the length of the strings. This is because each character in the strings is visited once.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(1)** space, as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        int sum = 0;
        for(char c : t) sum += c;
        for(char c : s) sum -= c;
        return (char)sum;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- \( 0 \leq \text{s.length} \leq 1000 \)
- \( \text{t.length} = \text{s.length} + 1 \)
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently finds the additional letter using the summation of ASCII values.
- The solution handles edge cases, such as when `s` is an empty string.
- The use of ASCII values allows for a straightforward and efficient comparison of characters.
