# ðŸ”— **Add Two Numbers**

## Problem Description

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list. You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to add two numbers represented by linked lists and return the sum as a linked list.

## âœ¨ **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: l1 = [2, 4, 3], l2 = [5, 6, 4]
Output: [7, 0, 8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: l1 = [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], l2 = [9, 9, 9, 9]
Output: [8, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 1]
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Simulation of Addition**

The algorithm simulates the addition of two numbers digit by digit:

- **Initialization**:
  - Create a dummy node to simplify the addition process.
  - Initialize a pointer `ptr` to the dummy node.
  - Initialize a variable `carry` to 0 to keep track of the carry-over during addition.

- **Addition**:
  - Traverse both lists using a loop.
  - For each digit, calculate the sum including the carry.
  - Update the carry for the next digit.
  - Create a new node with the current digit sum and move the pointer forward.

- **Final Carry**:
  - After the loop, if there is a remaining carry, add a new node with the carry value.

- **Return the Result**:
  - Return the next node of the dummy node, which is the head of the resultant list.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(max(m, n))** time, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two lists. This is because each node is visited once.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(max(m, n))** space, as it creates a new list to store the result.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* addTwoNumbers(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2) {
        ListNode* result = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode* ptr = result;
        int carry = 0;
        while (l1 || l2) {
            int sum = carry;

            if (l1) {
                sum += l1->val;
                l1 = l1->next;
            }
            if (l2) {
                sum += l2->val;
                l2 = l2->next;
            }
            carry = sum / 10;
            sum = sum % 10;
            ptr->next = new ListNode(sum);
            ptr = ptr->next;
        }
        if (carry == 1) ptr->next = new ListNode(1);
        return result->next;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- \( 0 \leq \text{Node.val} \leq 9 \)
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently adds two numbers represented by linked lists using a simulation of the addition process.
- The solution handles edge cases, such as when one list is longer than the other.
- The use of a dummy node simplifies the addition process.
