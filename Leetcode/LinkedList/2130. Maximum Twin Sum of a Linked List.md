# ðŸ”— **Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List**

## Problem Description

In a linked list of size `n`, where `n` is even, the `i-th` node (0-indexed) of the linked list is known as the twin of the `(n-1-i)-th` node, if \( 0 \leq i \leq (n / 2) - 1 \).

For example, if `n = 4`, then node 0 is the twin of node 3, and node 1 is the twin of node 2. These are the only nodes with twins for `n = 4`.

The twin sum is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.

Given the head of a linked list with even length, return the maximum twin sum of the linked list.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to find the maximum twin sum in the linked list.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: head = [5, 4, 2, 1]
Output: 6
Explanation:
- Nodes 0 and 1 are the twins of nodes 3 and 2, respectively. All have twin sum = 6.
- There are no other nodes with twins in the linked list.
- Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is 6.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: head = [4, 2, 2, 3]
Output: 7
Explanation:
- The nodes with twins present in this linked list are:
  - Node 0 is the twin of node 3 having a twin sum of 4 + 3 = 7.
  - Node 1 is the twin of node 2 having a twin sum of 2 + 2 = 4.
- Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is max(7, 4) = 7.
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1, 100000]
Output: 100001
Explanation:
- There is only one node with a twin in the linked list having twin sum of 1 + 100000 = 100001.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Finding the Middle and Reversing the Second Half**:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use the slow and fast pointer technique to find the middle of the linked list.
   - Reverse the second half of the linked list starting from the middle.

2. **Finding the Middle**:
   - Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both starting from the head of the linked list.
   - Move `slow` one step and `fast` two steps at a time until `fast` reaches the end of the list.
   - The `slow` pointer will be at the middle of the list.

3. **Reversing the Second Half**:
   - Reverse the second half of the linked list starting from the middle.
   - Initialize `prev` to `nullptr` and `curr` to the middle node.
   - Iterate through the second half, reversing the links between nodes.

4. **Calculating Twin Sums**:
   - Traverse the first half and the reversed second half simultaneously.
   - Calculate the twin sum for each pair of nodes and keep track of the maximum twin sum.

5. **Result**:
   - Return the maximum twin sum.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the length of the linked list. This is because we traverse the list to find the middle, reverse the second half, and traverse both halves to calculate the twin sums.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(1)** extra space, excluding the space required for the linked list.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* findMiddle(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head;
        while (fast && fast->next) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
        }
        return slow;
    }

    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* prev = nullptr;
        ListNode* curr = head;
        while (curr) {
            ListNode* nextNode = curr->next;
            curr->next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = nextNode;
        }
        return prev;
    }

    int pairSum(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* endStop = findMiddle(head);
        int maxisum = 0;
        ListNode* second_half = reverseList(endStop);
        ListNode* first_half = head;
        while (second_half) {
            maxisum = max(maxisum, second_half->val + first_half->val);
            first_half = first_half->next;
            second_half = second_half->next;
        }
        return maxisum;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- The number of nodes in the list is an even integer in the range [2, 10^5].
- \( 1 \leq \text{Node.val} \leq 10^5 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently finds the maximum twin sum using the slow and fast pointer technique to find the middle and reversing the second half of the linked list.
- The solution handles the input effectively within the given constraints.
- The use of in-place reversal allows for an **O(n)** time complexity solution with constant extra space.
