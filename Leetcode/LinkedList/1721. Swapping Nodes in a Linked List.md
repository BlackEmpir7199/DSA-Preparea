# ðŸ”— **Swapping Nodes in a Linked List**

## Problem Description

You are given the head of a linked list and an integer `k`. The goal is to swap the values of the `k-th` node from the beginning and the `k-th` node from the end (the list is 1-indexed).

Return the head of the linked list after performing the swap.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to swap the values of the `k-th` node from the beginning and the `k-th` node from the end in the linked list.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 2
Output: [1, 4, 3, 2, 5]
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: head = [7, 9, 6, 6, 7, 8, 3, 0, 9, 5], k = 5
Output: [7, 9, 6, 6, 8, 7, 3, 0, 9, 5]
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Two-Pointer Technique**

The algorithm efficiently swaps the values of the `k-th` nodes using a two-pointer technique:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use two pointers, `leftptr` and `rightptr`, both initialized to the head of the linked list.
   - Use an additional pointer `endptr` to keep track of the `k-th` node from the end.

2. **Locate the `k-th` Node from the Beginning**:
   - Move the `rightptr` pointer `k-1` steps to locate the `k-th` node from the beginning.
   - Set `endptr` to point to the same node as `rightptr`.

3. **Locate the `k-th` Node from the End**:
   - Move both `leftptr` and `rightptr` pointers one step at a time until `rightptr` reaches the end of the list.
   - At this point, `leftptr` will be pointing to the `k-th` node from the end.

4. **Swap the Values**:
   - Swap the values of the nodes pointed to by `endptr` and `leftptr`.

5. **Return the Modified List**:
   - Return the head of the modified linked list.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the list.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(1)** extra space.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* swapNodes(ListNode* head, int k) {
        ListNode* leftptr = head, *rightptr = head;
        for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; i++) rightptr = rightptr->next;
        ListNode* endptr = rightptr;
        while (rightptr->next) {
            leftptr = leftptr->next;
            rightptr = rightptr->next;
        }
        swap(endptr->val, leftptr->val);
        return head;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
- \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^5 \)
- \( 0 \leq \text{Node.val} \leq 100 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently swaps the values of the `k-th` nodes using a two-pointer technique.
- The solution handles large inputs effectively within the given constraints.
- The use of pointers allows for efficient traversal and manipulation of the linked list.
