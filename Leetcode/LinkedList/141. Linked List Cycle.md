# ðŸ”— **Linked List Cycle**

## Problem Description

Given the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it. There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to determine if a linked list contains a cycle.

## âœ¨ **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: head = [3, 2, 0, -4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1, 2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm**

The algorithm uses Floyd's Tortoise and Hare technique to detect a cycle:

- **Initialization**:
  - Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both starting at the head of the list.

- **Traversal**:
  - Move the `slow` pointer one step at a time.
  - Move the `fast` pointer two steps at a time.
  - If there is a cycle, the `slow` and `fast` pointers will eventually meet.

- **Cycle Detection**:
  - If the `slow` and `fast` pointers meet, return `true`.
  - If the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list, return `false`.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where `n` is the number of nodes in the list. This is because each node is visited at most twice.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(1)** space, as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head;
        while (fast && fast->next) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
            if (slow == fast) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

---

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- \( -10^5 \leq \text{Node.val} \leq 10^5 \)
- `pos` is `-1` or a valid index in the linked-list.

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently detects a cycle using Floyd's Tortoise and Hare technique.
- The solution handles edge cases, such as when the list is empty or has only one node.
- The use of two pointers allows for an efficient traversal of the list.
