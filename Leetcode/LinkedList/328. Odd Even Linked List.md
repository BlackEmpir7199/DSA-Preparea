# ðŸ”— **Odd Even Linked List**

## Problem Description

Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list. The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on. Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

You must solve the problem in **O(1)** extra space complexity and **O(n)** time complexity.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to reorder the linked list such that all nodes with odd indices come first, followed by all nodes with even indices.

## âœ¨ **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [1, 3, 5, 2, 4]
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: head = [2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 7]
Output: [2, 3, 6, 7, 1, 5, 4]
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Two-Pointer Technique**

The algorithm uses two pointers to separate the odd and even indexed nodes:

- **Initialization**:
  - Handle the edge case where the list is empty or has only one node.
  - Initialize two pointers, `odd` and `even`, where `odd` starts at the head and `even` starts at the second node.
  - Use `evenHead` to keep track of the head of the even list.

- **Traversal**:
  - Traverse the list using the `odd` and `even` pointers.
  - Connect the `odd` pointer to the next odd indexed node and move the `odd` pointer forward.
  - Connect the `even` pointer to the next even indexed node and move the `even` pointer forward.

- **Reordering**:
  - After the traversal, connect the last odd node to the head of the even list.
  - Return the head of the modified list.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where `n` is the number of nodes in the list. This is because each node is visited once.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(1)** space, as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* oddEvenList(ListNode* head) {
        if (head == NULL || head->next == NULL) return head;

        ListNode* odd = head;
        ListNode* even = head->next;
        ListNode* evenHead = even;

        while (even && even->next) {
            odd->next = odd->next->next;
            odd = odd->next;
            even->next = even->next->next;
            even = even->next;
        }

        odd->next = evenHead;
        return head;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- \( -10^6 \leq \text{Node.val} \leq 10^6 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently reorders the linked list using two pointers.
- The solution handles edge cases, such as when the list is empty or has only one node.
- The use of pointers allows for an efficient traversal and reordering of the list.
