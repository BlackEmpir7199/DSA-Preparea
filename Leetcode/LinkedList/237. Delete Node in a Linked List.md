# ðŸ”— **Delete Node in a Linked List**

## Problem Description

Given a singly-linked list and a node to be deleted, delete the given node. You will not be given access to the first node of the list. All the values of the linked list are unique, and it is guaranteed that the given node is not the last node in the linked list.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to delete the given node from the linked list.

## âœ¨ **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: head = [4, 5, 1, 9], node = 5
Output: [4, 1, 9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5. The linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: head = [4, 5, 1, 9], node = 1
Output: [4, 5, 9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1. The linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Copy and Swap**

The algorithm uses a copy and swap technique to delete the given node:

- **Initialization**:
  - Copy the value of the next node to the current node.
  - Update the `next` pointer of the current node to skip the next node.

- **Deletion**:
  - The next node is effectively removed from the list by updating the pointers.
  - Delete the next node from memory to free up space.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(1)** time, as it only involves updating pointers and copying values.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(1)** space, as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    void deleteNode(ListNode* node) {
        ListNode* discard = node->next;
        node->val = node->next->val;
        node->next = node->next->next;
        delete discard;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range `[2, 1000]`.
- \( -1000 \leq \text{Node.val} \leq 1000 \)
- The value of each node in the list is unique.
- The node to be deleted is in the list and is not a tail node.

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently deletes the given node using a copy and swap technique.
- The solution handles the constraints well and ensures that the node is accurately removed from the list.
- The use of pointer manipulation allows for an efficient deletion of the node.
