# ðŸ”— **Linked List Cycle II**

## Problem Description

Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`. There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to (0-indexed). It is `-1` if there is no cycle.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to detect the starting node of a cycle in a linked list and return that node. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

## âœ¨ **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: head = [3, 2, 0, -4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1, 2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm**

The algorithm uses Floyd's Tortoise and Hare technique to detect the starting node of the cycle:

- **Initialization**:
  - Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both starting at the head of the list.

- **Cycle Detection**:
  - Move the `slow` pointer one step at a time.
  - Move the `fast` pointer two steps at a time.
  - If there is a cycle, the `slow` and `fast` pointers will eventually meet.

- **Finding the Cycle Start**:
  - Once the `slow` and `fast` pointers meet, initialize another pointer at the head.
  - Move both the head pointer and the `slow` pointer one step at a time until they meet.
  - The meeting point is the start of the cycle.

- **No Cycle**:
  - If the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list, return `null`.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where `n` is the number of nodes in the list. This is because each node is visited at most twice.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(1)** space, as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode* fast = head;
        ListNode* slow = head;

        while (fast && fast->next) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;

            if (slow == fast) {
                while (head != slow) {
                    head = head->next;
                    slow = slow->next;
                }
                return slow;
            }
        }
        return NULL;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- \( -10^5 \leq \text{Node.val} \leq 10^5 \)
- `pos` is `-1` or a valid index in the linked-list.

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently detects the starting node of a cycle using Floyd's Tortoise and Hare technique.
- The solution handles edge cases, such as when the list is empty or has only one node.
- The use of pointers allows for an efficient traversal and detection of the cycle.
