# ðŸ”— **Reverse Linked List II**

## Problem Description

Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers `left` and `right` where `left <= right`, reverse the nodes of the list from position `left` to position `right`, and return the reversed list.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to reverse a sublist within a linked list defined by the indices `left` and `right`.

## âœ¨ **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], left = 2, right = 4
Output: [1, 4, 3, 2, 5]
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: head = [5], left = 1, right = 1
Output: [5]
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Sublist Reversal**

The algorithm uses a dummy node and pointers to reverse the sublist:

- **Initialization**:
  - Create a dummy node to simplify edge cases.
  - Initialize pointers to traverse to the start of the sublist (`prehead`) and the node just before the sublist (`curr`).

- **Traverse to Sublist**:
  - Move `prehead` and `curr` to the positions just before `left` and at `left`, respectively.

- **Reverse Sublist**:
  - Use three pointers (`prev`, `curr`, `next`) to reverse the nodes from `left` to `right`.
  - After reversing, connect the reversed sublist back to the original list.

- **Return the Head**:
  - Return the next node of the dummy node, which is the new head of the list.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where `n` is the number of nodes in the list. This is because each node is visited at most once.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(1)** space, as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseBetween(ListNode* head, int left, int right) {
        if (head == NULL || head->next == NULL) return head;

        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy->next = head;
        ListNode* curr = head;
        ListNode* prehead = dummy;

        for (int i = 0; i < left - 1; i++) {
            curr = curr->next;
            prehead = prehead->next;
        }

        ListNode* subhead = curr;
        ListNode* prev = NULL;
        ListNode* next;

        for (int i = 0; i <= right - left; i++) {
            next = curr->next;
            curr->next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = next;
        }

        subhead->next = curr;
        prehead->next = prev;

        return dummy->next;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
- \( 1 \leq n \leq 500 \)
- \( -500 \leq \text{Node.val} \leq 500 \)
- \( 1 \leq \text{left} \leq \text{right} \leq n \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently reverses a sublist within a linked list using pointers.
- The solution handles edge cases, such as when the sublist is the entire list or a single node.
- The use of a dummy node simplifies the handling of edge cases.
