# 🔗 **Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List**

## Problem Description

You are given the head of a linked list. The goal is to delete the middle node and return the head of the modified linked list.

The middle node of a linked list of size `n` is the `⌊n / 2⌋`th node from the start using 0-based indexing, where `⌊x⌋` denotes the largest integer less than or equal to `x`.

For example:
- For `n = 1`, the middle node is `0`.
- For `n = 2`, the middle node is `1`.
- For `n = 3`, the middle node is `1`.
- For `n = 4`, the middle node is `2`.
- For `n = 5`, the middle node is `2`.

## 🎯 **Objective**

Write a function to delete the middle node of the linked list and return the head of the modified list.

## ✨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]
Output: [1,3,4,1,2,6]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list. The indices of the nodes are written below.
Since n = 7, node 3 with value 7 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
We return the new list after removing this node.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list.
For n = 4, node 2 with value 3 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: head = [2,1]
Output: [2]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list.
For n = 2, node 1 with value 1 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
Node 0 with value 2 is the only node remaining after removing node 1.
```

## 🚀 **Approach**

### **Two-Pointer Technique**

The algorithm efficiently deletes the middle node using the two-pointer (fast and slow pointer) technique:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use two pointers, `fast` and `slow`, both initialized to the head of the linked list.
   - Use a `prev` pointer to keep track of the node before the `slow` pointer.

2. **Traverse the List**:
   - Move the `fast` pointer two steps at a time and the `slow` pointer one step at a time.
   - When the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list, the `slow` pointer will be at the middle node.

3. **Delete the Middle Node**:
   - Update the `next` pointer of the `prev` node to skip the middle node.
   - Delete the middle node to free up memory.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the list has only one node, return `NULL`.
   - If the list has two nodes, remove the second node and return the head.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the list.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(1)** extra space.

## 💡 **Code Implementation**

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* deleteMiddle(ListNode* head) {
        if (!(head->next)) return NULL;
        if (!(head->next->next)) {
            head->next = NULL;
            return head;
        }
        ListNode* fast = head;
        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* prev;
        while (fast && fast->next) {
            prev = slow;
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
        }
        prev->next = slow->next;
        slow->next = NULL;
        delete slow;
        return head;
    }
};
```

## 🔧 **Constraints**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

## 🌟 **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently deletes the middle node using the two-pointer technique.
- The solution handles large inputs effectively within the given constraints.
- The use of two pointers allows for a linear time complexity solution with constant space.
