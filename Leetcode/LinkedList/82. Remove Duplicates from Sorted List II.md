# ðŸ”— **Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II**

## Problem Description

Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to remove all duplicate nodes from a sorted linked list and return the modified list with only distinct numbers.

## âœ¨ **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]
Output: [1, 2, 5]
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]
Output: [2, 3]
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Dummy Node and Two-Pointer Technique**

The algorithm uses a dummy node and two pointers to efficiently remove duplicates:

- **Initialization**:
  - Create a dummy node that points to the head of the list. This helps in handling edge cases where the head itself needs to be removed.
  - Initialize two pointers, `prev` and `curr`, where `prev` starts at the dummy node and `curr` starts at the head.

- **Traversal**:
  - Traverse the list using the `curr` pointer.
  - If `curr` and `curr->next` have the same value, move `curr` forward until the duplicate values end.
  - Update `prev->next` to skip all duplicate nodes.
  - If `curr` and `curr->next` have different values, move `prev` forward.

- **Return the Head**:
  - Return the next node of the dummy node, which is the new head of the list.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where `n` is the number of nodes in the list. This is because each node is visited at most twice.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(1)** space, as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* deleteDuplicates(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0, head);
        ListNode* prev = dummy;
        ListNode* curr = head;

        while (curr) {
            if (curr->next && curr->val == curr->next->val) {
                while (curr->next && curr->val == curr->next->val) {
                    curr = curr->next;
                }
                prev->next = curr->next;
            } else {
                prev = prev->next;
            }
            curr = curr->next;
        }

        return dummy->next;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 300]`.
- \( -100 \leq \text{Node.val} \leq 100 \)
- The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently removes all duplicate nodes using a dummy node and two pointers.
- The solution handles edge cases, such as when the head itself needs to be removed.
- The use of pointers allows for an efficient traversal and modification of the list.
