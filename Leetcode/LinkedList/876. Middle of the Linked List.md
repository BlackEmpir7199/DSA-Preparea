# ðŸ”— **Middle of the Linked List**

## Problem Description

Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list. If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to find and return the middle node of the linked list.

## âœ¨ **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [3, 4, 5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: [4, 5, 6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Two-Pointer Technique**

The algorithm uses the two-pointer technique (also known as the tortoise and hare approach) to find the middle node:

- **Initialization**:
  - Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both starting at the head of the list.

- **Traversal**:
  - Move the `slow` pointer one step at a time.
  - Move the `fast` pointer two steps at a time.
  - When the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list, the `slow` pointer will be at the middle node.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where `n` is the number of nodes in the list. This is because each node is visited at most twice.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(1)** space, as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* middleNode(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* fast = head;
        ListNode* slow = head;
        while(fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
        }
        return slow;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- \( 1 \leq \text{Node.val} \leq 100 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently finds the middle node using the two-pointer technique.
- The solution handles both odd and even length lists correctly.
- The use of pointers allows for an efficient traversal of the list.
