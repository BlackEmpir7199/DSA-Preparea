# ðŸ”— **Merge Two Sorted Lists**

## Problem Description

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists, `list1` and `list2`. Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists. Return the head of the merged linked list.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to merge two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list.

## âœ¨ **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: list1 = [1, 2, 4], list2 = [1, 3, 4]
Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4]
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Dummy Node Technique**

The algorithm uses a dummy node to simplify the merging process:

- **Initialization**:
  - Create a dummy node to serve as the starting point of the merged list.
  - Initialize a pointer `head3` to the dummy node.

- **Merging**:
  - Iterate through both lists, comparing the values of the current nodes.
  - Append the smaller node to the merged list and move the pointer of the corresponding list forward.
  - Continue this process until one of the lists is exhausted.

- **Appending Remaining Nodes**:
  - If there are remaining nodes in either list, append them to the merged list.

- **Result**:
  - The merged list starts from `dummy->next`.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n + m)** time, where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `list1` and `list2`, respectively. This is because each node is visited once.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(1)** space, as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* mergeTwoLists(ListNode* list1, ListNode* list2) {
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode();
        ListNode* head3 = dummy;
        while (list1 && list2) {
            if (list1->val < list2->val) {
                head3->next = list1;
                list1 = list1->next;
            } else {
                head3->next = list2;
                list2 = list2->next;
            }
            head3 = head3->next;
        }
        while (list1) {
            head3->next = list1;
            list1 = list1->next;
            head3 = head3->next;
        }
        while (list2) {
            head3->next = list2;
            list2 = list2->next;
            head3 = head3->next;
        }
        return dummy->next;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
- \( -100 \leq \text{Node.val} \leq 100 \)
- Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in non-decreasing order.

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently merges two sorted linked lists using a dummy node.
- The solution handles edge cases, such as when one or both lists are empty.
- The use of pointers allows for an efficient traversal and merging of the lists.
