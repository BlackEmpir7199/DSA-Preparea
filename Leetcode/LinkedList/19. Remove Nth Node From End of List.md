# ðŸ”— **Remove Nth Node From End of List**

## Problem Description

Given the head of a linked list, remove the `n`th node from the end of the list and return its head.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to remove the `n`th node from the end of the linked list and return the modified list.

## âœ¨ **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], n = 2
Output: [1, 2, 3, 5]
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1, 2], n = 1
Output: [1]
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Two-Pointer Technique**

The algorithm uses the two-pointer technique to find and remove the `n`th node from the end:

- **Initialization**:
  - Create a dummy node that points to the head of the list. This helps in handling edge cases where the head itself needs to be removed.
  - Initialize two pointers, `first` and `second`, both pointing to the dummy node.

- **Advance First Pointer**:
  - Move the `first` pointer `n` steps ahead.

- **Move Both Pointers**:
  - Move both `first` and `second` pointers one step at a time until the `first` pointer reaches the end of the list.
  - At this point, the `second` pointer will be just before the node that needs to be removed.

- **Remove the Node**:
  - Update the `next` pointer of the `second` node to skip the node to be removed.

- **Return the Head**:
  - Return the next node of the dummy node, which is the new head of the list.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where `n` is the number of nodes in the list. This is because each node is visited at most twice.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(1)** space, as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
        ListNode* res = new ListNode(0, head);
        ListNode* dummy = res;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            head = head->next;
        }

        while (head != nullptr) {
            head = head->next;
            dummy = dummy->next;
        }

        dummy->next = dummy->next->next;

        return res->next;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- The number of nodes in the list is `sz`.
- \( 1 \leq \text{sz} \leq 30 \)
- \( 0 \leq \text{Node.val} \leq 100 \)
- \( 1 \leq n \leq \text{sz} \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently removes the `n`th node from the end using the two-pointer technique.
- The solution handles edge cases, such as when the head itself needs to be removed.
- The use of a dummy node simplifies the edge case handling.
