# ðŸ”— **Intersection of Two Linked Lists**

## Problem Description

Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`. The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to find and return the intersection node of two linked lists.

## âœ¨ **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4, 1, 8, 4, 5], listB = [5, 6, 1, 8, 4, 5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Intersected at '8'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8. From the head of A, it reads as [4, 1, 8, 4, 5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5, 6, 1, 8, 4, 5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1, 9, 1, 2, 4], listB = [3, 2, 4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Intersected at '2'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2. From the head of A, it reads as [1, 9, 1, 2, 4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3, 2, 4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There is 1 node before the intersected node in B.
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2, 6, 4], listB = [1, 5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: No intersection
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Two-Pointer Technique**

The algorithm uses the two-pointer technique to find the intersection node:

- **Initialization**:
  - Initialize two pointers, `ptr1` and `ptr2`, to the heads of `listA` and `listB`, respectively.

- **Traversal**:
  - Traverse both lists using the two pointers.
  - When a pointer reaches the end of a list, redirect it to the head of the other list.
  - Continue this process until the two pointers meet.

- **Intersection**:
  - If the two pointers meet at a non-null node, that node is the intersection node.
  - If the two pointers meet at `null`, there is no intersection.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(m + n)** time, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two lists. This is because each node is visited at most twice.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(1)** space, as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB) {
        ListNode* ptr1 = headA;
        ListNode* ptr2 = headB;
        while (ptr1 != ptr2) {
            if (ptr1 == NULL) ptr1 = headB;
            else ptr1 = ptr1->next;
            if (ptr2 == NULL) ptr2 = headA;
            else ptr2 = ptr2->next;
        }
        return ptr1;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- The number of nodes of `listA` is `m`.
- The number of nodes of `listB` is `n`.
- \( 1 \leq m, n \leq 3 \times 10^4 \)
- \( 1 \leq \text{Node.val} \leq 10^5 \)
- \( 0 \leq \text{skipA} \leq m \)
- \( 0 \leq \text{skipB} \leq n \)
- `intersectVal` is 0 if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect.
- `intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect.

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently finds the intersection node using the two-pointer technique.
- The solution handles edge cases, such as when there is no intersection.
- The use of pointers allows for an efficient traversal of the lists.
