# ðŸ”— **Reorder List**

## Problem Description

You are given the head of a singly linked list. Reorder the list such that the nodes are arranged in the following form:

L0 â†’ Ln â†’ L1 â†’ Ln-1 â†’ L2 â†’ Ln-2 â†’ â€¦

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to reorder the linked list as described.

## âœ¨ **Examples**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: [1, 4, 2, 3]
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [1, 5, 2, 4, 3]
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Three-Step Approach**

The algorithm uses a three-step approach to reorder the list:

1. **Find the Middle**:
   - Use the slow and fast pointer technique to find the middle of the list.
   - Split the list into two halves.

2. **Reverse the Second Half**:
   - Reverse the second half of the list in place.

3. **Merge the Two Halves**:
   - Merge the two halves by alternately taking nodes from each half.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where `n` is the number of nodes in the list. This is because each node is visited a constant number of times.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(1)** space, as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    void reorderList(ListNode* head) {
        if (!head || !head->next) return;

        // Step 1: Find the middle of the list
        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head;
        while (fast->next && fast->next->next) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
        }

        // Step 2: Reverse the second half of the list
        ListNode* second = slow->next;
        slow->next = nullptr;
        ListNode* prev = nullptr;
        ListNode* curr = second;
        while (curr) {
            ListNode* nextTemp = curr->next;
            curr->next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = nextTemp;
        }

        // Step 3: Merge the two halves
        ListNode* first = head;
        second = prev;
        while (second) {
            ListNode* temp1 = first->next;
            ListNode* temp2 = second->next;
            first->next = second;
            second->next = temp1;
            first = temp1;
            second = temp2;
        }
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 5 * 10^4]`.
- \( 1 \leq \text{Node.val} \leq 1000 \)

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently reorders the linked list using a three-step approach.
- The solution handles edge cases, such as when the list has only one node.
- The use of pointers allows for an efficient traversal and manipulation of the list.
