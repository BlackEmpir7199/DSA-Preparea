# ðŸ”— **Merge Nodes in Between Zeros**

## Problem Description

You are given the head of a linked list, which contains a series of integers separated by `0`s. The beginning and end of the linked list will have `Node.val == 0`.

For every two consecutive `0`s, merge all the nodes lying in between them into a single node whose value is the sum of all the merged nodes. The modified list should not contain any `0`s.

Return the head of the modified linked list.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to merge the nodes between consecutive `0`s and return the head of the modified linked list.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: head = [0, 3, 1, 0, 4, 5, 2, 0]
Output: [4, 11]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains:
- The sum of the nodes marked in green: 3 + 1 = 4.
- The sum of the nodes marked in red: 4 + 5 + 2 = 11.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: head = [0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 2, 2, 0]
Output: [1, 3, 4]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains:
- The sum of the nodes marked in green: 1 = 1.
- The sum of the nodes marked in red: 3 = 3.
- The sum of the nodes marked in yellow: 2 + 2 = 4.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Iterative Approach**

The algorithm efficiently merges the nodes between consecutive `0`s using an iterative approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a pointer `ptr` to traverse the linked list starting from the second node (since the first node is always `0`).
   - Use a dummy node `ans` to build the modified linked list.
   - Use a pointer `head` to keep track of the start of the modified linked list.

2. **Traversal and Merging**:
   - Iterate through the linked list using the pointer `ptr`.
   - For each segment of nodes between consecutive `0`s, calculate the sum of the node values.
   - Create a new node with the calculated sum and append it to the modified linked list.
   - Move the pointer `ptr` to the next segment of nodes.

3. **Return the Modified List**:
   - Return the head of the modified linked list, which is `head->next`.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the linked list.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(1)** extra space.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* mergeNodes(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* ptr = head->next;
        ListNode* ans = new ListNode(-1);
        head = ans;
        while (ptr) {
            int sum = 0;
            while (ptr->val != 0) {
                sum += ptr->val;
                ptr = ptr->next;
            }
            ListNode* node = new ListNode(sum);
            ans->next = node;
            ans = node;
            ptr = ptr->next;
        }
        return head->next;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[3, 2 * 10^5]`.
- \( 0 \leq \text{Node.val} \leq 1000 \)
- There are no two consecutive nodes with `Node.val == 0`.
- The beginning and end of the linked list have `Node.val == 0`.

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently merges the nodes between consecutive `0`s using an iterative approach.
- The solution handles large inputs effectively within the given constraints.
- The use of a dummy node simplifies the construction of the modified linked list.
