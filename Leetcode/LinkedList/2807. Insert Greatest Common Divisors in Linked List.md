# ðŸ”— **Insert Greatest Common Divisors in Linked List**

## Problem Description

Given the head of a linked list where each node contains an integer value, insert a new node with a value equal to the greatest common divisor (GCD) between every pair of adjacent nodes. Return the modified linked list.

The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the largest positive integer that evenly divides both numbers.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

Write a function to insert the GCD of each pair of adjacent nodes into the linked list.

## âœ¨ **Example**

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: head = [18, 6, 10, 3]
Output: [18, 6, 6, 2, 10, 1, 3]
Explanation:
- Insert the GCD of 18 and 6 (which is 6) between the 1st and 2nd nodes.
- Insert the GCD of 6 and 10 (which is 2) between the 2nd and 3rd nodes.
- Insert the GCD of 10 and 3 (which is 1) between the 3rd and 4th nodes.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: head = [7]
Output: [7]
Explanation: There are no pairs of adjacent nodes, so return the initial linked list.
```

## ðŸš€ **Approach**

### **Algorithm**:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Define a helper function `gcd` to compute the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - Use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, to traverse the linked list.

2. **Traversal and Insertion**:
   - Start with `slow` pointing to the head and `fast` pointing to the next node.
   - For each pair of adjacent nodes (`slow` and `fast`), compute their GCD.
   - Create a new node with the computed GCD and insert it between `slow` and `fast`.
   - Move `slow` to `fast` and `fast` to the next node.
   - Continue this process until `fast` reaches the end of the list.

### **Time Complexity**:
- The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because each node is visited exactly once.

### **Space Complexity**:
- The algorithm uses **O(1)** extra space, excluding the space required for the new nodes.

## ðŸ’¡ **Code Implementation**

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
    }

public:
    ListNode* insertGreatestCommonDivisors(ListNode* head) {
        if (head->next == NULL) return head;
        ListNode* fast = head->next;
        ListNode* slow = head;
        while (fast) {
            int gcds = gcd(fast->val, slow->val);
            ListNode* newNode = new ListNode(gcds);
            slow->next = newNode;
            newNode->next = fast;
            slow = fast;
            fast = fast->next;
        }
        return head;
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **Constraints**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5000].
- \( 1 \leq \text{Node.val} \leq 1000 \).

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Points**

- The algorithm efficiently inserts the GCD of each pair of adjacent nodes into the linked list.
- The solution handles the input effectively within the given constraints.
- The use of two pointers (`slow` and `fast`) simplifies the traversal and insertion process.
