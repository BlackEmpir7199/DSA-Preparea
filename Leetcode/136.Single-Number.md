**LeetCode - 136. Single Number üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**

**Problem:** 

Imagine you're a detective on a mission. You have a list of suspects (integers), but there's a twist: every suspect appears twice, except for one. Your job is to find the lone wolf ‚Äì the single number that doesn't have an accomplice! 

* **Find the problem here:** [Single Number - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

**The Challenge:**

You need to find the single number in an array of integers where every other number appears exactly twice. 

**My Approach (The Detective's Method):**

I'm going to use a clever trick: the **XOR (exclusive OR)** operation. 

* **XOR Magic:** 
    * XOR of a number with itself is always 0. 
        * Think of it like a magical cancellation: "Number XOR Number" = "Poof! Gone!" 
    * XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.

* **The Detective's Plan:**
    1. I'll start with a "neutral" value (0).
    2. I'll "interview" each suspect (integer) in the array.
    3. For each interview, I'll perform XOR with the suspect. 

    * **The magic happens:** 
        * If a suspect has an accomplice, they cancel each other out (XOR = 0). 
        * Only the lone wolf remains!

**My Code (The Detective's Notebook):**

```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int res=0; 
        for(int i:nums) res^=i; // Interviewing each suspect
        return res; // The lone wolf is revealed!
    }
}
```

**Time and Space Complexity:**

* **Time Complexity: O(n)** 
    * I interview each suspect once, so it takes time proportional to the number of suspects (n).
* **Space Complexity: O(1)** 
    * I only need a tiny bit of memory to keep track of the lone wolf.

**Why This Works (The Detective's Explanation):**

Imagine a secret handshake:

* **Handshake Rule:** Only identical suspects can perform the secret handshake (XOR).
* **The Lone Wolf:** Since the lone wolf has no accomplice, the secret handshake fails, and they stand out!

**Conclusion:**

By leveraging the power of XOR, I've successfully identified the lone wolf in the array! 

**Note:** This solution is not only efficient but also quite elegant. It's a perfect example of how a bit of mathematical magic can solve a seemingly complex problem.

I hope this README is both informative and entertaining! Feel free to explore other solutions in this repository. 

Happy coding!
